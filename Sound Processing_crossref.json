The stimulus sets of each audio descriptor were synthesized and (wherever possible) independently controlled through appropriate synthesis techniques. Partition scaling methods were used in both experiments, and the scales were constructed by fitting well-behaving functions to the listeners' ratings. In the first experiment, the listeners' task was the estimation of the relative differences between successive levels of a particular audio descriptor. The median values of listeners' ratings increased with increasing feature values, which confirmed listeners' abilities to estimate intervals. However, there was a large variability in the reliability of the derived interval scales depending on the stimulus spacing in each trial. In the second experiment, listeners had control over the stimulus values and were asked to divide the presented range of values into perceptually equal intervals, which provides a ratio scale. For every descriptor, the reliability of the derived ratio scales was excellent. The unit of a particular ratio scale was assigned empirically so as to facilitate qualitative comparisons between the scales of all audio descriptors. The construction of psychophysical scales based on univariate stimuli allowed for the establishment of cause-and-effect relations between audio descriptors and perceptual dimensions, contrary to past research that has relied on multivariate stimuli and has only examined the correlations between the two. Most importantly, this study provides an understanding of the ways in which the sensation magnitudes of several audio descriptors are apprehended.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835401","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T19:23:47Z","timestamp":1648668227000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Interval and Ratio Scaling of Spectral Audio Descriptors"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Savvas","family":"Kazazis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"1892","DOI":"10.3758/s13414-017-1394-6","article-title":"Brightness scaling of periodic tones","volume":"79","author":"Almeida","year":"2017","journal-title":"Attent.

In presenting this holistic approach to mapping techniques, we apply the framework to existing works from the literature as well as to new implementations that consider this approach in their construction. As any mapping control structure for a given digital instrument is determined by the musical context in which it is used, we present musical examples that relate the relatively abstract realm of mapping design to the physically and perceptually grounded notions of control and sonic gesture. Making this connection allows mapping to be more clearly seen as a linkage between a physical action and a sonic result. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to translate the discussion on mapping so that it links an abstract and formalized approach—intended for representation and conceptualization—with a viewpoint that considers mapping in its role as a perceived correspondence between physical materials (i.e., those that act on controllers and transducers) and sonic events. This correspondence is, at its heart, driven by our cognitive and embodied understanding of the acoustic world. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,15]],"date-time":"2014-09-15T19:26:23Z","timestamp":1410809183000},"page":"6-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Mapping Control Structures for Sound Synthesis: Functional and Topological Perspectives"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Doug","family":"Van Nort","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Arts, Media, Performance, and Design York University 4700 Keele St. Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}]}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002054"},{"key":"p_3","first-page":"101","author":"Bencina R.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_4","first-page":"85","author":"Bevilaqua F.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_5","first-page":"181","author":"Bowler I.","year":"1990","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"38","author":"Chadabe J.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771810000154"},{"key":"p_10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002029"},{"key":"p_11","first-page":"57","author":"Hülsen H.","year":"2008","journal-title":"Springer"},{"key":"p_13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002030"},{"key":"p_14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/TASSP.1986.1164910"},{"key":"p_16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15"},{"key":"p_18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0898-1221(88)90255-6"},{"key":"p_19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/BF00893171"},{"key":"p_20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2006.30.1.49"},{"key":"p_21","first-page":"54","author":"Momeni A.","year":"2003","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_22","first-page":"68","author":"Rovan J.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Proceedings of Kansei: The Technology of Emotion Workshop"},{"key":"p_23","first-page":"138","author":"Schnell N.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1076/jnmr.28.2.81.3116"},{"key":"p_25","first-page":"375","author":"Serafin S.","year":"1999","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_26","first-page":"21","author":"Sibson R.","year":"1981","journal-title":"Interpreting Multivariate Data.

The STFT of an AM–FM component or mode spreads the information relative to that mode in the TF plane around curves commonly called\n            <jats:italic>ridges</jats:italic>\n            . An alternative view is to consider a mode as a particular TF domain termed a\n            <jats:italic>basin of attraction</jats:italic>\n            . Here we discuss two new approaches to mode reconstruction. The first determines the ridge associated with a mode by considering the location where the direction of the reassignment vector sharply changes, the technique used to determine the basin of attraction being directly derived from that used for ridge extraction. A second uses the fact that the STFT of a signal is fully characterized by its zeros (and then the particular distribution of these zeros for Gaussian noise) to deduce an algorithm to compute the mode domains. For both techniques, mode reconstruction is then carried out by simply integrating the information inside these basins of attraction or domains.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1098/rsta.2015.0205","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,8]],"date-time":"2016-03-08T01:53:41Z","timestamp":1457402021000},"page":"20150205","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":29,"title":["Adaptive multimode signal reconstruction from time–frequency representations"],"prefix":"10.1098","volume":"374","author":[{"given":"Sylvain","family":"Meignen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann (UMR CNRS 5224), Université Joseph Fourier, 51 rue des Mathématiques, Campus de Saint Martin d’Hères, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 09, France"}]},{"given":"Thomas","family":"Oberlin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"IRIT and INP-ENSEEIHT (UMR CNRS 5505), Université de Toulouse, 2 rue Charles Camichel, BP 7122, 31071 Toulouse Cedex 07, France"}]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), McGill University, 527 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1E3"}]},{"given":"Patrick","family":"Flandrin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire de Physique (UMR CNRS 5672), ENS de Lyon, Université de Lyon, 46 allée d’Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9558-8294","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephen","family":"McLaughlin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Riccarton, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK"}]}],"member":"175","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,13]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_4_2_2","volume-title":"Time–frequency/time-scale analysis","author":"Flandrin P","year":"1999"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_3_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4612-0003-1"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_4_2","volume-title":"Time–frequency signal analysis and processing: a comprehensive reference","author":"Boashash B","year":"2003"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_5_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0031-9201(76)90044-3"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_6_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/78.382394"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_7_2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Daubechies I Maes S. 1996 A nonlinear squeezing of the continuous wavelet transform based on auditory nerve models.

This study aims to identify the most effective algorithm to create a realistic sound for rolling objects. In Experiment\n 1 and 2, participants were asked to rate the extent to which 6 different versions sounded like rolling sounds. Subsequently, in Experiment 3, participants compared the 6 versions best rated in Experiment 1 and 2, to the original recordings. Results are presented in terms of both statistical\n analysis of the most effective synthesis algorithm and qualitative user comments. On methodological grounds, the comparison of Experiments 1, 2 and 3 highlights major differences between judgments collected in reference to the original recordings as opposed to judgments based on memory representations\n of rolling sounds.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3813/aaa.918464","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,29]],"date-time":"2011-08-29T10:08:27Z","timestamp":1314612507000},"page":"840-851","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Perceptual Evaluation of Rolling Sound Synthesis"],"prefix":"10.3813","volume":"97","author":[{"given":"Emma","family":"Murphy","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mathieu","family":"Lagrange","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gary","family":"Scavone","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Catherine","family":"Guastavino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"30674","container-title":["Acta Acustica united with Acustica"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2011/00000097/00000005/art00014","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]],"date-time":"2020-06-04T04:30:54Z","timestamp":1591245054000},"score":18.919308,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.3813/AAA.918464"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"5","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,1]]}},"alternative-id":["1610-1928(20110901)97:5L.840;1-"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3813/aaa.918464","ISSN":["1610-1928"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1610-1928","type":"print"}],"subject":["Music","Acoustics and Ultrasonics"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,1]]}}],"items-per-page":20,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}

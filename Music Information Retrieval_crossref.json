This removal process is an important step for many Optical Music Recognition systems and facilitates the segmentation and recognition of musical symbols. The process is complicated by the fact that most music symbols are placed on top of stavelines and these lines are often neither straight nor parallel to each other. The challenge here is to remove as much of stavelines as possible while preserving the shapes of the musical symbols, which are superimposed on stavelines. Various problematic examples are illustrated and a detailed explanation of an algorithm is presented. Image processing techniques used in the algorithm include: run-length coding, connected-component analysis, and projections.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,24]],"date-time":"2011-05-24T17:13:39Z","timestamp":1306257219000},"page":"1-39","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":34,"title":["Staff Detection and Removal"],"prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Ichiro","family":"Fujinaga","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":["Visual Perception of Music Notation"],"link":[{"URL":"https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=31053","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,14]],"date-time":"2018-11-14T11:05:28Z","timestamp":1542193528000},"score":26.082743,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001"}},"subtitle":[""],"issued":{"date-parts":[[null]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T23:52:37Z","timestamp":1648684357160},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"SPIE","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1993,1,20]]},"DOI":"10.1117/12.139262","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,9,16]],"date-time":"2004-09-16T18:01:43Z","timestamp":1095357703000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["&lt;title&gt;Optical music recognition system which learns&lt;/title&gt;"],"prefix":"10.1117","author":[{"given":"Ichiro","family":"Fujinaga","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"189","event":{"name":"Fibers '92","location":"Boston, MA"},"container-title":["SPIE Proceedings","Enabling Technologies for High-Bandwidth Applications"],"link":[{"URL":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1000510","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,6]],"date-time":"2017-03-06T19:06:05Z","timestamp":1488827165000},"score":26.082743,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1000510"}},"editor":[{"given":"Jacek","family":"Maitan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1993,1,20]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.139262","ISSN":["0277-786X"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0277-786X","type":"print"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[1993,1,20]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T11:19:40Z","timestamp":1648811980148},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Acoustical Society of America (ASA)","issue":"5","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["J.

The model is built following the symmetric hierarchical motivic scheme and then applied to the organ work of Max Reger. It was shown that music expressive content is carried by the model parameter defined as temporal elasticity. Along with the standard analytical and empirical evaluation, the model was also evaluated in terms of its naturalness. We found that the correlation between model and human performance is comparable with the correlation between distinct professional human interpretations.

These sophisticated techniques come with pitfalls, however, and their accidental misuse can lead to erroneous results. This article outlines in broad terms our experiences with a large-scale, long-term international project to digitize musical scores, automatically analyze them, and share the results with other researchers. It then describes our experiences in order to help other researchers in the DH avoid some of the missteps we and other DH researchers have made. In addition to issues associated with data mining, this article also discusses approaches to sharing data, software, and intermediate analyses such that they are accessible to other researchers in ways that encourage repeatability, verifiability, iterative refinement, creative exploration, and multidisciplinary collaboration.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqaa058","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]],"date-time":"2020-10-05T19:14:21Z","timestamp":1601925261000},"page":"ii198-ii202","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Lessons

For the correct analysis of music elements and their interpretation, the identification of staff lines is of key importance. In this paper, a scheme to post-process the output of a previous musical object identification system is described. This system allows the reconstruction by means of detection, tracking and interpolation of the staff lines of ancient scores from the digital Salzinnes Database. The scheme developed shows a remarkable performance on the specific task it was created

An e-Research approach has been adopted in order to create a very substantive web-accessible corpus of musical analyses in a common framework for use by music scholars, students and beyond, and to establish a methodology and tooling that will enable others to add to the resource in the future. The enabling infrastructure brings together scientific workflow and Semantic Web technologies with a set of algorithms and tools for extracting features from recorded music. It has been used to deliver a prototype system, described here, that demonstrates the utility of L\n            <jats:sc>inked</jats:sc>\n            D\n            <jats:sc>ata</jats:sc>\n            for enhancing the curation of collections of music signal data for analysis and publishing results that can be simply and readily correlated to these and other sources.

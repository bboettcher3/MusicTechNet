A variety of systems is currently available, ranging from optical, multi-camera (passive and/or active) infra-red systems and inertial systems (using orientation sensors) to electromagnetic trackers providing six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) measurement per marker/sensor. Recent advances in technology have made many of these systems more affordable, allowing access to a large research community. Music-related mocap applications include the tracking movements of solo or group, beginner, or expert performers and instruments for teaching performance skills, comparing movement strategies across performers, generating movement synthesis parameters in animation, and use in real-time music interaction. This chapter introduces the basic concepts behind motion capture, reviews the most common mocap technologies used in the study of music performance, and presents several examples of research, pedagogy, and artistic uses. Mocap of single acoustic instrument performances is reviewed, including violin, cello, piano, clarinet, timpani, and acoustic guitar, as well as examples of mocap of multiple instruments. Finally, we discuss the limitations of mocap and possible solutions to overcome them.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.013.30","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,13]],"date-time":"2022-04-13T08:49:42Z","timestamp":1649839782000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Motion Capture of Music Performances"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"container-title":["The Oxford Handbook of Music Performance, Volume 2"],"original-title":["Motion Capture of Music Performances"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,13]],"date-time":"2022-04-13T08:49:42Z","timestamp":1649839782000},"score":22.69019,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190058869-e-30"}},"editor":[{"given":"Gary E.","family":"McPherson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.013.30","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"mtIDs":[1]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T02:01:13Z","timestamp":1649210473812},"edition-number":"1","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Presses de l'Université du Québec","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,19]]},"DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv28m3h84.9","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,28]],"date-time":"2022-01-28T20:20:49Z","timestamp":1643401249000},"page":"29-40","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["La recherche interdisciplinaire:"],"prefix":"10.2307","author":[{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1121","container-title":["Récits de professeurs d’université à mi-carrière"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,28]],"date-time":"2022-01-28T20:21:00Z","timestamp":1643401260000},"score":22.641924,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv28m3h84.9"}},"subtitle":["La voie royale ou une voie sans issue ?"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,19]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv28m3h84.9","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,19]]},"mtIDs":[1]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,7]],"date-time":"2022-04-07T00:39:14Z","timestamp":1649291954788},"publisher-location":"Berlin, Heidelberg","reference-count":9,"publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","isbn-type":[{"value":"9783540436782","type":"print"},{"value":"9783540478737","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"DOI":"10.1007/3-540-47873-6_26","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,24]],"date-time":"2007-10-24T21:47:29Z","timestamp":1193262449000},"page":"241-253","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":41,"title":["Quantitative Analysis of Non-obvious Performer Gestures"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2002,5,7]]},"reference":[{"key":"26_CR1","unstructured":"C.

Augmented instruments are acoustic instruments onto which sensors have been mounted in order to provide extra sonic control variables. Trumpets make ideal candidates for augmentation because they have spare physical space on which to mount electronics and spare performer “bandwidth” with which to interact with the augmentations. </jats:p><jats:p> In this article, underlying concepts of augmented instrument design are discussed along with a review and discussion of twelve existing augmented trumpets and five projects related to mouthpiece augmentation. Common aspects to many of these examples are identified, such as the prevalence of idiosyncratic designs, the use of buttons placed at or near the left-hand playing position, and the focus on measuring or mimicking trumpet valves. Three existing approaches to valve sensing are compared, and a novel method for sensing valve position, based on linear variable differential transformers, is introduced. Based on the review and comparison, we created an example augmented trumpet that tests the feasibility of a modular design paradigm. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of this review of the state-of-the-art and our own research suggests future directions towards a better understanding of augmented trumpet design. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00185","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,26]],"date-time":"2013-09-26T18:51:12Z","timestamp":1380221472000},"page":"12-25","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Trumpet Augmentation and Technological Symbiosis"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"37","author":[{"given":"Joseph","family":"Thibodeau","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), Schulich School of Music, McGill University, 555 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), Schulich School of Music, McGill University, 555 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0021-9290(88)90147-9"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080/09298215.2011.646278"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"5","author":"Bowers J.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_7","first-page":"1","author":"Cook P.

This study investigated the contribution of ancillary body movements on the perception of musical performances. Using kinematic displays of four clarinetists, perceptual experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to rate specific music-related dimensions of the performance and the performer. Additionally, motions of particular body parts, such as movements of the arms and torso, as well as motion amplitudes of the whole body were manipulated in the kinematic display. It was found that manipulations of arm and torso movements have fewer effects on the observers' ratings of the musicians than manipulations concerning the movement of the whole body. The results suggest that the multimodal experience of musicians is less dependent on the players' particular body motion behaviors than it is on the players' overall relative motion characteristics.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2009.26.4.335","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,18]],"date-time":"2009-03-18T00:03:00Z","timestamp":1237334580000},"page":"335-353","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":42,"title":["Music and Motion——How Music-Related Ancillary Body Movements Contribute to the Experience of Music"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"26","author":[{"given":"Manfred","family":"Nusseck","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tüübingen, Germany"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1163/156856897X00357"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"411","DOI":"10.1007/BF03395235","volume":"47","author":"BROWNLOW S.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Psychological Record"},{"key":"p_4","first-page":"644","volume":"14","author":"BULL P.","year":"2001","journal-title":"The Psychologist"},{"key":"p_5","first-page":"71","volume-title":"M.

At times the relationship between emotion and sonification has been contentious due to an implied overlap with music. This paper clarifies the relationship, demonstrating how it can be mutually beneficial. After identifying contexts favourable to auditory display of emotion, and the utility of its development to research in musical emotion, the current state of the field is addressed, reiterating the necessary conditions for sound to qualify as a sonification of emotion. With this framework, strategies for display are presented that use acoustic and structural cues designed to target select auditory-cognitive mechanisms of musical emotion. Two sonifications are then described using these strategies to convey arousal and valence though differing in design methodology: one designed ecologically, the other computationally. Each model is sampled at 15-second intervals at 49 evenly distributed points on the <jats:italic>AV</jats:italic> space, and evaluated using a publically available tool for computational music emotion recognition. The computational design performed 65 times better in this test, but the ecological design is argued to be more useful for emotional communication. Conscious of these limitations, computational design and evaluation is supported for future development.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/s1355771813000411","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,26]],"date-time":"2014-02-26T10:42:46Z","timestamp":1393411366000},"page":"60-69","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Sonification of Emotion: Strategies and results from the intersection with music"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"R.

El presente dossier tiene como objeto el clero secular iberoamericano, considerando las líneas de investigación y los problemas relacionados con la historia social del clero y su historiografía. Pretende, en particular, comprender sus trayectorias públicas, sus redes de apoyo y las estrategias particulares que condicionan y caracterizan el camino de esos eclesiásticos en diferentes contextos sociopolíticos y geográficos. En este sentido, contribuye a la comprensión de cómo el clero secular concibió su posición desde las jerarquías sociales y también cómo experimentó diversos límites frente a las normas en el ámbito eclesiástico y civil. De esta forma, los textos presentados subrayan tanto su papel en el proceso de consolidación de la Iglesia en el mundo iberoamericano, como los proyectos de ciertos segmentos sociales que reclamaron espacios en el mundo eclesiástico para sus descendientes.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1590/tem-1980-542x2020v260308","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]],"date-time":"2020-11-16T16:08:09Z","timestamp":1605542889000},"page":"645-661","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["El clero secular iberoamericano en la Época Moderna.

Its elaboration was informed by a systematic review of 181 peer-reviewed publications retrieved from the Scopus database, which describe 195 interactive sound installations. The resulting taxonomy is based on the comparison of the different facets of the installations reported in the literature and on existing frameworks, and it was used to characterize all publications. A visualization tool was developed to explore the different facets and identify trends and gaps in the literature. The main findings are presented in terms of bibliometric analysis, and from the three perspectives considered. Various trends were derived from the database, among which we found that interactive sound installations are of prominent interest in the field of computer science. Furthermore, most installations described in the corpus consist of prototypes or belong to exhibitions, output two sensory modalities and include three or more sound sources. Beyond the trends, this review highlights a wide range of practices and a great variety of approaches to the design of interactive sound installations.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390/mti5040019","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T09:52:00Z","timestamp":1618221120000},"page":"19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Comprehensive

In presenting this holistic approach to mapping techniques, we apply the framework to existing works from the literature as well as to new implementations that consider this approach in their construction. As any mapping control structure for a given digital instrument is determined by the musical context in which it is used, we present musical examples that relate the relatively abstract realm of mapping design to the physically and perceptually grounded notions of control and sonic gesture. Making this connection allows mapping to be more clearly seen as a linkage between a physical action and a sonic result. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to translate the discussion on mapping so that it links an abstract and formalized approach—intended for representation and conceptualization—with a viewpoint that considers mapping in its role as a perceived correspondence between physical materials (i.e., those that act on controllers and transducers) and sonic events. This correspondence is, at its heart, driven by our cognitive and embodied understanding of the acoustic world. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,15]],"date-time":"2014-09-15T19:26:23Z","timestamp":1410809183000},"page":"6-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Mapping Control Structures for Sound Synthesis: Functional and Topological Perspectives"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Doug","family":"Van Nort","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Arts, Media, Performance, and Design York University 4700 Keele St. Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002054"},{"key":"p_3","first-page":"101","author":"Bencina R.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_4","first-page":"85","author":"Bevilaqua F.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_5","first-page":"181","author":"Bowler I.","year":"1990","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"38","author":"Chadabe J.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771810000154"},{"key":"p_10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002029"},{"key":"p_11","first-page":"57","author":"Hülsen H.","year":"2008","journal-title":"Springer"},{"key":"p_13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002030"},{"key":"p_14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/TASSP.1986.1164910"},{"key":"p_16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15"},{"key":"p_18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0898-1221(88)90255-6"},{"key":"p_19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/BF00893171"},{"key":"p_20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2006.30.1.49"},{"key":"p_21","first-page":"54","author":"Momeni A.","year":"2003","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_22","first-page":"68","author":"Rovan J.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Proceedings of Kansei: The Technology of Emotion Workshop"},{"key":"p_23","first-page":"138","author":"Schnell N.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1076/jnmr.28.2.81.3116"},{"key":"p_25","first-page":"375","author":"Serafin S.","year":"1999","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_26","first-page":"21","author":"Sibson R.","year":"1981","journal-title":"Interpreting Multivariate Data.

The full use of such vocabularies is nevertheless challenged when improvisers incorporate electronics in their performances. To control electronic sounds and effects, they typically use commercial interfaces whose physicality is likely to limit their freedom of movement. Based on Jim Black's descriptions of his ideal digital musical instrument, embodied improvisation gestures, and stage performance constraints, we develop the concept of a modular wearable MIDI interface to closely meet the needs of professional improvisers, rather than proposing a new generic instrument that would require substantial practice to adapt improvisational techniques already acquired. Our research draws upon different bodies of knowledge, from theoretical principles on collaboration and embodiment to wearable interface design, in order to create a digital vest called <jats:italic>Track It, Zip It (TIZI)</jats:italic> that features two innovative on-body sensors. Allowing for sound control, these sensors are seamlessly integrated with Black's improvisational gesture vocabulary. We then detail the design process of three TIZI prototypes structured by the outcomes of a performance test with Black, a public performance by a novice improviser during the 2017 International Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, and measurements of sensor responses. After commenting on the strengths and weaknesses of the final TIZI prototype, we discuss how our interdisciplinary and collective process involving a world-class improviser at the very center of the design process can provide recommendations to designers who wish to create interfaces better adapted to high-level performers. Finally, we present our goals for the future creation of a wireless version of the vest for a female body based on Diana Policarpo's artistic vision.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.576810","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T04:36:25Z","timestamp":1618202185000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Connecting Free Improvisation Performance and Drumming Gestures Through Digital Wearables"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Amandine","family":"Pras","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Mailis G.","family":"Rodrigues","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Victoria","family":"Grupp","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","unstructured":"AndersonL.\n          Laurie Anderson - Drum Dance & Smoke Rings1986"},{"key":"B2","unstructured":"ArthursT.\n          EdinburghThe University of Edinburgh.Secret Gardeners: An Ethnography of Improvised Music in Berlin"},{"key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"450","DOI":"10.1080/07494467.2016.1257569","article-title":"The creative process of sculpting the air by Jesper Nordin: conceiving and performing a concerto for conductor with live electronics","volume":"35","author":"Bacot","year":"2016","journal-title":"Contemp.

Research has focused on parallels in acoustic features, overlooking facial cues to emotion. In three experiments, we compared moving facial expressions in speech and song. In Experiment 1, vocalists spoke and sang statements each with five emotions. Vocalists exhibited emotion-dependent movements of the eyebrows and lip corners that transcended speech–song differences. Vocalists’ jaw movements were coupled to their acoustic intensity, exhibiting differences across emotion and speech–song. Vocalists’ emotional movements extended beyond vocal sound to include large sustained expressions, suggesting a communicative function. In Experiment 2, viewers judged silent videos of vocalists’ facial expressions prior to, during, and following vocalization. Emotional intentions were identified accurately for movements during and after vocalization, suggesting that these movements support the acoustic message. Experiment 3 compared emotional identification in voice-only, face-only, and face-and-voice recordings. Emotion judgements for voice-only singing were poorly identified, yet were accurate for all other conditions, confirming that facial expressions conveyed emotion more accurately than the voice in song, yet were equivalent in speech. Collectively, these findings highlight broad commonalities in the facial cues to emotion in speech and song, yet highlight differences in perception and acoustic-motor production. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1080/17470218.2014.971034","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,26]],"date-time":"2014-11-26T05:38:51Z","timestamp":1416980331000},"page":"952-970","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Common cues to emotion in the dynamic facial expressions of speech and song"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"68","author":[{"given":"Steven R.","family":"Livingstone","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 1B1"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"William F.","family":"Thompson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Music Research, CIRMMT, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Caroline","family":"Palmer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 1B1"}],"isLabHead":false}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/s10919-008-0059-5"},{"key":"bibr2-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1068/p5096"},{"key":"bibr3-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/a0025827"},{"key":"bibr4-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0096-1523.4.3.373"},{"key":"bibr5-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2049"},{"key":"bibr6-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x"},{"key":"bibr7-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1214/aos/1013699998"},{"key":"bibr9-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1163/156856897X00357"},{"key":"bibr10-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/0146167286121001"},{"key":"bibr11-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1515/semi.2004.036"},{"key":"bibr12-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080/14640748108400805"},{"key":"bibr13-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/79.911197"},{"key":"bibr14-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1121/1.2982369"},{"key":"bibr15-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1167/9.13.7"},{"key":"bibr16-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00136-0"},{"key":"bibr18-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/030573569302100201"},{"key":"bibr20-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1044/jshr.3303.550"},{"key":"bibr21-17470218.2014.971034","volume-title":"Manual of the facial action coding system (FACS)","author":"Ekman P.","year":"1978"},{"key":"bibr22-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203"},{"key":"bibr23-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/1130938"},{"key":"bibr24-17470218.2014.971034","first-page":"223","volume-title":"Music and emotion: Theory and research","author":"Gabrielsson A.","year":"2001"},{"key":"bibr25-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/1416710"},{"key":"bibr26-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.319"},{"key":"bibr27-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1159/000263031"},{"key":"bibr28-17470218.2014.971034","first-page":"309","volume-title":"Music and emotion: Theory and research","author":"Juslin P.

This removal process is an important step for many Optical Music Recognition systems and facilitates the segmentation and recognition of musical symbols. The process is complicated by the fact that most music symbols are placed on top of stavelines and these lines are often neither straight nor parallel to each other. The challenge here is to remove as much of stavelines as possible while preserving the shapes of the musical symbols, which are superimposed on stavelines. Various problematic examples are illustrated and a detailed explanation of an algorithm is presented. Image processing techniques used in the algorithm include: run-length coding, connected-component analysis, and projections.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,24]],"date-time":"2011-05-24T17:13:39Z","timestamp":1306257219000},"page":"1-39","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":34,"title":["Staff Detection and Removal"],"prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Ichiro","family":"Fujinaga","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"2432","container-title":["Visual Perception of Music Notation"],"link":[{"URL":"https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=31053","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,14]],"date-time":"2018-11-14T11:05:28Z","timestamp":1542193528000},"score":26.122166,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001"}},"subtitle":[""],"issued":{"date-parts":[[null]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59140-298-5.ch001","mtIDs":[140]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T18:16:27Z","timestamp":1648836987660},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Acoustical Society of America (ASA)","issue":"5","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["J.

The model is built following the symmetric hierarchical motivic scheme and then applied to the organ work of Max Reger. It was shown that music expressive content is carried by the model parameter defined as temporal elasticity. Along with the standard analytical and empirical evaluation, the model was also evaluated in terms of its naturalness. We found that the correlation between model and human performance is comparable with the correlation between distinct professional human interpretations.   </jats:p>","DOI":"10.35699/2317-6377.2020.26080","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]],"date-time":"2021-07-12T17:12:09Z","timestamp":1626109929000},"page":"1-17","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["\"Life, Color, Warmth and Truth\""],"prefix":"10.35699","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0905-7631","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yulia","family":"Draginda","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2524-8582","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ichiro","family":"Fujinaga","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"21381","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"container-title":["Per Musi"],"link":[{"URL":"https://periodicos.ufmg.br/index.php/permusi/article/download/26080/27513","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://periodicos.ufmg.br/index.php/permusi/article/download/26080/27513","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,12]],"date-time":"2021-07-12T17:12:10Z","timestamp":1626109930000},"score":22.884642,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://periodicos.ufmg.br/index.php/permusi/article/view/26080"}},"subtitle":["Expressive timing in German late Romantic organ music"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"40","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.35699/2317-6377.2020.26080","ISSN":["2317-6377","1517-7599"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2317-6377","type":"electronic"},{"value":"1517-7599","type":"print"}],"subject":["Music"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,21]]},"mtIDs":[145,140]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]],"date-time":"2022-04-04T08:11:19Z","timestamp":1649059879282},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":17,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]],"date-time":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1470960000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000155","name":"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"DOI":"10.1145/2970044.2970055","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,11]],"date-time":"2016-08-11T13:14:55Z","timestamp":1470921295000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Digitizing musical scores"],"prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Audrey","family":"Laplante","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"École de bibliothéconomie et des sciences, de l'information, Université de Montréal, CIRMMT"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Ichiro","family":"Fujinaga","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CIRMMT"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_2_1_1_1","first-page":"9","article-title":"Ongoing challenges in digitization","volume":"34","author":"Breeding M","year":"2014","journal-title":"Computers in Libraries"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_1_2_1","first-page":"6","article-title":"Digital workflow management","volume":"5","author":"Choudhury G.

These sophisticated techniques come with pitfalls, however, and their accidental misuse can lead to erroneous results. This article outlines in broad terms our experiences with a large-scale, long-term international project to digitize musical scores, automatically analyze them, and share the results with other researchers. It then describes our experiences in order to help other researchers in the DH avoid some of the missteps we and other DH researchers have made. In addition to issues associated with data mining, this article also discusses approaches to sharing data, software, and intermediate analyses such that they are accessible to other researchers in ways that encourage repeatability, verifiability, iterative refinement, creative exploration, and multidisciplinary collaboration.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqaa058","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]],"date-time":"2020-10-05T19:14:21Z","timestamp":1601925261000},"page":"ii198-ii202","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Lessons

For the correct analysis of music elements and their interpretation, the identification of staff lines is of key importance. In this paper, a scheme to post-process the output of a previous musical object identification system is described. This system allows the reconstruction by means of detection, tracking and interpolation of the staff lines of ancient scores from the digital Salzinnes Database. The scheme developed shows a remarkable performance on the specific task it was created

Psychol."],"abstract":"<jats:p>Technological advances over the past 50 years or so have resulted in the development of a succession of hardware and software systems intended to improve the quality and effectiveness of Western music instrument pedagogy during classroom instruction or individual study. These systems have aimed to provide evaluation or visualization of single or combined technical aspects by analyzing performance data collected in real time or offline. The number of such educational technologies shows an ever-increasing trend over time, aided by the wide diffusion and availability of mobile devices. However, we believe there are unrealized opportunities for modern technologies to help music students in their technical development and assist them during their practice sessions in between visits to their teachers. The ubiquity of PCs and mobile devices with built-in microphones, speakers, and cameras has inspired the development of media technologies in support of music pedagogy. They offer an attractive potential for implementing audio signal processing algorithms addressing different technical skills of the performer, providing real-time feedback, collecting data over time, and applying statistical models. Despite this potential, most available software for music instrument pedagogy remains very limited in functionality. This study provides a survey of music edTech software available, together with the methods of use, addressed technical skills, commonalities, and limitations. Results show that most current software is based on the metronome and tuner, with only a few systems that have limited abilities to follow a performance in real-time and compare it to a given score to monitor correctness of notes, intonation, and rhythm. The survey also highlights a high and under-exploited potential regarding the monitoring of other more specific technical skills, which are more instrument-dependent, but no less important, such as the control of dynamic range and clarity of the attack. This article ends with a discussion of possible directions for future development of technologies to support the practice of music students at different levels, with some consideration for the corresponding signal processing methods that can be utilized or that need advancement. By helping students to more efficiently achieve a high level of proficiency of their instruments with assistive technologies, we hope to minimize stress and afford better enjoyment of the music performance experience for all.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835609","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]],"date-time":"2022-03-28T16:17:48Z","timestamp":1648484268000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Current State and Future Directions of Technologies for Music Instrument Pedagogy"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Alberto","family":"Acquilino","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Gary","family":"Scavone","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,22]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","volume-title":"Music Apps for Musicians and Music Teachers","author":"Axford","year":"2015"},{"key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"303","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-23807-0_25","article-title":"Instrumentor: An interactive robot for musical instrument tutoring","volume-title":"20th Annual Conference on Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems","author":"Bagga","year":"2019"},{"key":"B3","first-page":"414","article-title":"Good-sounds.org: a framework to explore goodness in instrumental sounds","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 17th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference","author":"Bandiera","year":"2016"},{"key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"694","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730810.013.0042","article-title":"The changing face of individual instrumental tuition: value, purpose and potential","volume":"1","author":"Creech","year":"2012","journal-title":"Oxford Handb.

sounds of sustained contact interactions. This study aims to identify the most effective algorithm to create a realistic sound for rolling objects. In Experiment\n 1 and 2, participants were asked to rate the extent to which 6 different versions sounded like rolling sounds. Subsequently, in Experiment 3, participants compared the 6 versions best rated in Experiment 1 and 2, to the original recordings. Results are presented in terms of both statistical\n analysis of the most effective synthesis algorithm and qualitative user comments. On methodological grounds, the comparison of Experiments 1, 2 and 3 highlights major differences between judgments collected in reference to the original recordings as opposed to judgments based on

The stimulus sets of each audio descriptor were synthesized and (wherever possible) independently controlled through appropriate synthesis techniques. Partition scaling methods were used in both experiments, and the scales were constructed by fitting well-behaving functions to the listeners' ratings. In the first experiment, the listeners' task was the estimation of the relative differences between successive levels of a particular audio descriptor. The median values of listeners' ratings increased with increasing feature values, which confirmed listeners' abilities to estimate intervals. However, there was a large variability in the reliability of the derived interval scales depending on the stimulus spacing in each trial. In the second experiment, listeners had control over the stimulus values and were asked to divide the presented range of values into perceptually equal intervals, which provides a ratio scale. For every descriptor, the reliability of the derived ratio scales was excellent. The unit of a particular ratio scale was assigned empirically so as to facilitate qualitative comparisons between the scales of all audio descriptors. The construction of psychophysical scales based on univariate stimuli allowed for the establishment of cause-and-effect relations between audio descriptors and perceptual dimensions, contrary to past research that has relied on multivariate stimuli and has only examined the correlations between the two. Most importantly, this study provides an understanding of the ways in which the sensation magnitudes of several audio descriptors are apprehended.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835401","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T19:23:47Z","timestamp":1648668227000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Interval and Ratio Scaling of Spectral Audio Descriptors"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Savvas","family":"Kazazis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"1892","DOI":"10.3758/s13414-017-1394-6","article-title":"Brightness scaling of periodic tones","volume":"79","author":"Almeida","year":"2017","journal-title":"Attent.

In presenting this holistic approach to mapping techniques, we apply the framework to existing works from the literature as well as to new implementations that consider this approach in their construction. As any mapping control structure for a given digital instrument is determined by the musical context in which it is used, we present musical examples that relate the relatively abstract realm of mapping design to the physically and perceptually grounded notions of control and sonic gesture. Making this connection allows mapping to be more clearly seen as a linkage between a physical action and a sonic result. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to translate the discussion on mapping so that it links an abstract and formalized approach—intended for representation and conceptualization—with a viewpoint that considers mapping in its role as a perceived correspondence between physical materials (i.e., those that act on controllers and transducers) and sonic events. This correspondence is, at its heart, driven by our cognitive and embodied understanding of the acoustic world. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,15]],"date-time":"2014-09-15T19:26:23Z","timestamp":1410809183000},"page":"6-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Mapping Control Structures for Sound Synthesis: Functional and Topological Perspectives"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Doug","family":"Van Nort","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Arts, Media, Performance, and Design York University 4700 Keele St. Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002054"},{"key":"p_3","first-page":"101","author":"Bencina R.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_4","first-page":"85","author":"Bevilaqua F.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_5","first-page":"181","author":"Bowler I.","year":"1990","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"38","author":"Chadabe J.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771810000154"},{"key":"p_10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002029"},{"key":"p_11","first-page":"57","author":"Hülsen H.","year":"2008","journal-title":"Springer"},{"key":"p_13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002030"},{"key":"p_14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/TASSP.1986.1164910"},{"key":"p_16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15"},{"key":"p_18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0898-1221(88)90255-6"},{"key":"p_19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/BF00893171"},{"key":"p_20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2006.30.1.49"},{"key":"p_21","first-page":"54","author":"Momeni A.","year":"2003","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_22","first-page":"68","author":"Rovan J.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Proceedings of Kansei: The Technology of Emotion Workshop"},{"key":"p_23","first-page":"138","author":"Schnell N.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1076/jnmr.28.2.81.3116"},{"key":"p_25","first-page":"375","author":"Serafin S.","year":"1999","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_26","first-page":"21","author":"Sibson R.","year":"1981","journal-title":"Interpreting Multivariate Data.

The STFT of an AM–FM component or mode spreads the information relative to that mode in the TF plane around curves commonly called\n            <jats:italic>ridges</jats:italic>\n            . An alternative view is to consider a mode as a particular TF domain termed a\n            <jats:italic>basin of attraction</jats:italic>\n            . Here we discuss two new approaches to mode reconstruction. The first determines the ridge associated with a mode by considering the location where the direction of the reassignment vector sharply changes, the technique used to determine the basin of attraction being directly derived from that used for ridge extraction. A second uses the fact that the STFT of a signal is fully characterized by its zeros (and then the particular distribution of these zeros for Gaussian noise) to deduce an algorithm to compute the mode domains. For both techniques, mode reconstruction is then carried out by simply integrating the information inside these basins of attraction or domains.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1098/rsta.2015.0205","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,8]],"date-time":"2016-03-08T01:53:41Z","timestamp":1457402021000},"page":"20150205","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":29,"title":["Adaptive multimode signal reconstruction from time–frequency representations"],"prefix":"10.1098","volume":"374","author":[{"given":"Sylvain","family":"Meignen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann (UMR CNRS 5224), Université Joseph Fourier, 51 rue des Mathématiques, Campus de Saint Martin d’Hères, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 09, France"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Thomas","family":"Oberlin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"IRIT and INP-ENSEEIHT (UMR CNRS 5505), Université de Toulouse, 2 rue Charles Camichel, BP 7122, 31071 Toulouse Cedex 07, France"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), McGill University, 527 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1E3"}],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Patrick","family":"Flandrin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire de Physique (UMR CNRS 5672), ENS de Lyon, Université de Lyon, 46 allée d’Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France"}],"isLabHead":false},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9558-8294","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephen","family":"McLaughlin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Riccarton, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, UK"}],"isLabHead":false}],"member":"175","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,13]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_4_2_2","volume-title":"Time–frequency/time-scale analysis","author":"Flandrin P","year":"1999"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_3_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4612-0003-1"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_4_2","volume-title":"Time–frequency signal analysis and processing: a comprehensive reference","author":"Boashash B","year":"2003"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_5_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0031-9201(76)90044-3"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_6_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/78.382394"},{"key":"e_1_3_4_7_2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Daubechies I Maes S. 1996 A nonlinear squeezing of the continuous wavelet transform based on auditory nerve models.

This article presents a theory of melodic expectation based on that assertion, describes two computer models of aspects of that theory, and finds strong support for that theory in comparisons of the behavior of those models with the behavior of participants in several experiments. The following summary statement of the theory is explained and illustrated in the article: Experienced listeners of tonal music expect completions in which the musical forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia control operations on alphabets in hierarchies of embellishment whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed shapes. A \"single-level\" computer program models the operation of these musical forces on a single level of musical structure. Given a melodic beginning in a certain key, the model not only produces almost the same responses as experimental participants, but it also rates them in a similar way; the computer model gives higher ratings to responses that participants sing more often. In fact, the completions generated by this model match note-for-note the entire completions sung by participants in several psychological studies as often as the completions of any one of those participants matches those of the other participants. A \"multilevel\" computer program models the operation of these musical forces on multiple hierarchical levels. When the multilevel model is given a melodic beginning and a hierarchical description of its embellishment structure (i.e., a Schenkerian analysis of it), the model produces responses that reflect the operation of musical forces on all the levels of that hierarchical structure. Statistical analyses of the results of a number of experiments test hypotheses arising from the computer models' algorithm (S. Larson, 1993a) for the interaction of musical forces as well as from F. Lerdahl's similar (1996) algorithm. Further statistical analysis contrasts the explanatory power of the theory of musical forces with that of E. Narmour's (1990, 1992) implication-realization model. The striking agreement between computer-generated responses and experimental results suggests that the theory captures some important aspects of melodic expectation. Furthermore, the fact that these data can be modeled well by the interaction of constantly acting but contextually determined musical forces gives support to the idea that we experience musical motions metaphorically in terms of our experience of physical motions.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,5,28]],"date-time":"2004-05-28T16:33:17Z","timestamp":1085761997000},"page":"457-498","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":41,"title":["Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models and Experimental Results"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"21","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Oregon, School of Music, 1225 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1225; e-mail: steve@uoregon.edu"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_2","unstructured":"Aksnes, H.

This chapter will outline connections between the orchestration practices of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and perceptual principles based on recent research in auditory scene analysis and timbre perception. Analyses of orchestration treatises and musical scores reveal an implicit understanding of auditory grouping principles by which many orchestral effects and techniques function. We will explore how concurrent grouping cues result in blended combinations of instruments, how sequential grouping into segregated melodies or stratified (foreground and background) layers is influenced by timbral similarities and dissimilarities, and how segmental grouping cues create formal boundaries and expressive gestural shaping through changes in instrumental textures. This exploration will be framed within an examination of historical and contemporary discussion of orchestral effects and techniques.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190637224.013.10","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,7]],"date-time":"2018-06-07T14:51:28Z","timestamp":1528383088000},"page":"495-524","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Perceptual

important for understanding aspects of orchestration, but no work has studied blends of impulsive and sustained instruments. The first experiment identified the factors that influence the rating of blendedness of dyads formed of one sustained sound and one impulsive sound. Longer attack times and lower spectral centroids increased blend. The contribution of the impulsive sound’s properties to the degree of blend was greater than that of the sustained sound. The second experiment determined the factors that influence similarity ratings among dyads. The mean spectral envelope and the attack time of the dyad best explained the dissimilarity ratings. However, contrary to the first experiment, the spectral envelope of the sustained sound was more important than that of the impulsive sound. Multidimensional scaling of dissimilarity ratings on blended dyads yielded one dimension correlated with the attack time of the dyad and another dimension whose spectral correlate was different for two different clusters within the space, spectral spread for one and spectral flatness for the other, suggesting a combined categorical-analogical organization of the second dimension.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.30.2.117","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,11]],"date-time":"2012-12-11T18:39:53Z","timestamp":1355251193000},"page":"117-128","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Perception of Dyads of Impulsive and Sustained Instrument Sounds"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"30","author":[{"given":"Damien","family":"Tardieu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"IRCAM-STMS-CNRS, Paris, France"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_1","unstructured":"ballet, g. & borghesi, r.

Determining when changes in these reactions tend to manifest themselves can help us understand how and why. Activity Analysis quantifies alignment of response events across listeners and listenings through continuous responses to musical works. Its coordination tests allow us to determine if there is enough inter-response coherence to merit linking their summary time series to the musical event structure and to identify moments of exceptional alignment in response events. In this paper, we apply Activity Analysis to continuous ratings from several music experiments, using this wealth of data to compare its performance with that of statistics used in previous studies. We compare the Coordination Scores and nonparametric measures of local activity coordination to other coherence measures, including those derived from correlations and Cronbach’s α. Activity Analysis reveals the variation in coordination of participants’ responses for different musical works, picks out moments of coordination in response to different interpretations of the same music, and demonstrates that responses along the two dimensions in continuous 2D rating tasks can be independent.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.35.3.253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,12]],"date-time":"2018-01-12T23:45:11Z","timestamp":1515800711000},"page":"253-294","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Activity Analysis and Coordination in Continuous Responses to Music"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"35","author":[{"given":"Finn","family":"Upham","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada & New York University"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/3/253/273867/mp_2018_35_3_253.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/3/253/273867/mp_2018_35_3_253.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]],"date-time":"2020-10-01T19:36:57Z","timestamp":1601581017000},"score":19.748941,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/35/3/253/91976/Activity-Analysis-and-Coordination-in-Continuous"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2018.35.3.253","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2018,2]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"mtIDs":[309,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T11:52:32Z","timestamp":1648986752180},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Informa UK Limited","issue":"1","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Contemporary Music Review"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]},"DOI":"10.1080/07494468900640161","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,6,27]],"date-time":"2006-06-27T14:13:46Z","timestamp":1151417626000},"page":"vii-ix","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Preface"],"prefix":"10.1080","volume":"4","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Irène","family":"Deliège","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false}],"member":"301","container-title":["Contemporary Music Review"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07494468900640161","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,12]],"date-time":"2016-12-12T21:52:53Z","timestamp":1481579573000},"score":19.748941,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07494468900640161"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1080/07494468900640161"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07494468900640161","ISSN":["0749-4467","1477-2256"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0749-4467","type":"print"},{"value":"1477-2256","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]},"mtIDs":[310,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T06:08:30Z","timestamp":1648966110340},"reference-count":2,"publisher":"Informa UK Limited","issue":"2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Contemporary Music Review"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2000,1]]},"DOI":"10.1080/07494460000640251","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,6,27]],"date-time":"2006-06-27T14:18:23Z","timestamp":1151417903000},"page":"33-59","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Acoustics, psychoacoustics and spectral music"],"prefix":"10.1080","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Pressnitzer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"301","reference":[{"key":"E00001","unstructured":"It should be noted that it is possible to obtain spectrograms in an analogous fashion with a bank of filters.

In this study, empathy is tested as a possible moderator between recognition and induction that is, on its own, moderated via music preference evaluations and other individual and situational features. Preference was also tested to determine whether it had an effect on measures of emotion independently from emotional expression. A web-based experiment gathered from 3,164 music listeners emotion, empathy, and preference ratings in a between-subjects design embedded in a music-personality test. Stimuli were a sample of 23 musical excerpts (each 30 seconds long, five randomly assigned to each participant) from various musical styles chosen to represent different emotions and preferences. Listeners in the recognition rating condition rated measures of valence and arousal significantly differently than listeners in the felt rating condition. Empathy ratings were shown to modulate this relationship: when empathy was present, the difference between the two rating types was reduced. Furthermore, we confirmed preference as one major predictor of empathy ratings. Emotional contagion was tested and confirmed as an additional direct effect of emotional expression on induced emotions. This study is among the first to explicitly test empathy and emotional contagion during music listening, helping to explain the often-reported emotional response to music in everyday life.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2013.31.2.139","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,5]],"date-time":"2013-12-05T22:40:50Z","timestamp":1386283250000},"page":"139-156","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":58,"title":["Empathy and Emotional Contagion as a Link Between Recognized and Felt Emotions in Music Listening"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"31","author":[{"given":"Hauke","family":"Egermann","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Technische Universität Berlin, Germany"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/j.jml.2007.12.005"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2010.03.013"},{"key":"p_4","volume-title":"Sentics - The touch of emotions","author":"CLYNES M."},{"issue":"8","key":"p_5","first-page":"103","volume":"12","author":"COLOMBETTI G.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Journal of Consciousness Studies"},{"key":"p_6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/1534582304267187"},{"key":"p_7","unstructured":"EEROLA, T., LARTILLOT, O. & TOIVIAINEN, P.

Four experiments examined short-term recognition of musical timbre using a serial recognition task in which listeners indicated whether the orders of the timbres of two subsequently presented sound sequences were identical or not. Experiment 1 revealed significant effects of sequence length on recognition accuracy and an interaction of music training and pitch variability: musicians performed better for variable-pitch sequences, but did not differ from nonmusicians with constant-pitch sequences. Experiment 2 yielded a significant effect of pitch variability for musicians when pitch patterns varied between standard and comparison sequences. Experiment 3 high-lighted the impact of the timbral dissimilarity of swapped sounds and indicated a recency effect in timbre recognition. Experiment 4 confirmed the importance of the dissimilarity of the swap, but did not yield any pertinent role of timbral heterogeneity of the sequence. Further analyses confirmed the strong correlation of the timbral dissimilarity of swapped sounds with response behavior, accounting for around 90% of the variance in response choices across all four experiments. These results extend findings regarding the impact of music training and pitch variability from the literature on timbre perception to the domain of short-term memory and demonstrate the mnemonic importance of timbre similarity relations among sounds in sequences. The role of the factors of music training, pitch variability, and timbral similarity in music listening is discussed.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.36.1.24","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,21]],"date-time":"2018-08-21T22:35:21Z","timestamp":1534890921000},"page":"24-39","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Short-term Recognition of Timbre Sequences"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"36","author":[{"given":"Kai","family":"Siedenburg","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada & Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"issue":"3","key":"2020093015233673200_ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1371","DOI":"10.1121/1.4863269","article-title":"Symmetric interactions and interference between pitch and timbre","volume":"135","year":"2014","journal-title":"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"},{"key":"2020093015233673200_ref2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Alluri, V., & Toiviainen, P.

multidimensional sensory attribute and as a carrier of perceptually useful information about the mechanics of the sound source. To date, research on musical timbre has focused on defining its acoustical correlates, whereas fragmentary evidence is available on the influence of mechanical parameters. We quantified the extent to which mechanical properties of the sound source are associated with structures in the data from published identification and dissimilarity-rating studies. We focus on two macroscopic mechanical properties: the musical instrument family and excitation type. Identification confusions are significantly more frequent for same-family instruments. With dissimilarity ratings, same-family or same-excitation tones are judged more similar and tend to occupy the same region of multidimensional-scaling spaces. As such, significant associations between the perception of musical timbre and the mechanics of the sound source emerge even when not explicitly demanded by the task.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2010.28.2.155","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,14]],"date-time":"2010-12-14T14:11:15Z","timestamp":1292335875000},"page":"155-168","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Sound

Musical timbre is a combination of continuous perceptual dimensions and discrete features to which listeners are differentially sensitive. The continuous dimensions often have quantifiable acoustic correlates. The timbre-space representation is a powerful psychological model that allows predictions to be made about timbre perception in situations beyond those used to derive the model in the first place. Timbre can play a role in larger-scale movements of tension and relaxation and thus contribute to the expression inherent in musical form. Under conditions of high blend among instruments composing a vertical sonority, timbral roughness is a major component of musical tension. However, it strongly depends on the way auditory grouping processes have parsed the incoming acoustic information into events and streams.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199298457.013.0007","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,13]],"date-time":"2013-02-13T05:41:41Z","timestamp":1360734101000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["The perception of musical timbre"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Bruno L.","family":"Giordano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false}],"member":"286","container-title":["Oxford Handbooks Online"],"original-title":["The perception of musical timbre"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,14]],"date-time":"2016-07-14T10:02:43Z","timestamp":1468490563000},"score":18.62438,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199298457.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199298457-e-007"}},"editor":[{"given":"Susan","family":"Hallam","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ian","family":"Cross","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Thaut","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,18]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199298457.013.0007","published":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,18]]},"mtIDs":[254,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]],"date-time":"2022-04-21T11:08:29Z","timestamp":1650539309415},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Acoustical Society of America (ASA)","issue":"2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1994,2]]},"DOI":"10.1121/1.408434","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,10,17]],"date-time":"2005-10-17T19:54:50Z","timestamp":1129578890000},"page":"1177-1178","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":123,"title":["<i>Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound</i>"],"prefix":"10.1121","volume":"95","author":[{"given":"Albert S.","family":"Bregman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"231","container-title":["The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1121/1.408434","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,28]],"date-time":"2016-12-28T21:27:28Z","timestamp":1482960448000},"score":18.62438,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.408434"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,2]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[1994,2]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1121/1.408434"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.408434","ISSN":["0001-4966"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0001-4966","type":"print"}],"subject":["Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)"],"published":{"date-parts":[[1994,2]]},"mtIDs":[328,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T15:20:42Z","timestamp":1648999242499},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Acoustical Society of America (ASA)","issue":"S1","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1985,11]]},"DOI":"10.1121/1.2022835","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,10,7]],"date-time":"2005-10-07T13:50:24Z","timestamp":1128693024000},"page":"S46-S46","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Discrimination of spectral density"],"prefix":"10.1121","volume":"78","author":[{"given":"W.

However, there are few theories related to orchestration that would assist in interpreting these empirical findings. This article investigates listeners’ emotional responses to four types of orchestral gestures – large-scale timbral and textural changes that occur in a coordinated, goal-directed manner – through an exploratory experiment that collected continuous responses of emotional intensity for musician and nonmusician listeners. A time series regression analysis was used to predict changes in emotional responses by modeling changes in several musical features, including instrumental texture, spectral centroid, loudness, and tempo. We demonstrate the application of a new visualization tool that compiles the emotional intensity ratings with score-based and performance-based musical features for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results suggest that the response profiles differ for the four gestural types. Following the increasing growth of instrumental texture and loudness, the emotional intensity ratings climbed steadily for the gradual addition types. The ratings for the sudden addition gestures sharply increased in response to the rapid textural change, peaking toward the end of the excerpt. There was a slight tendency for musicians, but not nonmusicians, to anticipate the moment of sudden addition with heightened emotional responses. The responses to the reductive excerpts, both gradual and sudden, feature a plateau of lingering high emotional intensity, despite the decrease of other musical features. The visualization provided a method to observe the evolution of listeners’ emotional reactions in response to the orchestral gestures and assisted in interpreting the results of the time series regression analysis. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177/1029864917704033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,12]],"date-time":"2017-05-12T13:13:15Z","timestamp":1494594795000},"page":"25-49","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Exploring emotional responses to orchestral gestures"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"23","author":[{"given":"Meghan","family":"Goodchild","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Wild","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-1029864917704033","volume-title":"The study of orchestration","author":"Adler S.","year":"2002","edition":"3"},{"key":"bibr2-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"100","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2005.11.007","volume":"100","author":"Bigand E.","year":"2006","journal-title":"Cognition"},{"issue":"8","key":"bibr3-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1113","DOI":"10.1080/02699930500204250","volume":"19","author":"Bigand E.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Cognition and Emotion"},{"key":"bibr4-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"161","DOI":"10.1080/07494468708567057","volume":"2","author":"Boulez P.","year":"1987","journal-title":"Contemporary Music Review"},{"key":"bibr5-1029864917704033","first-page":"356","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Auditory Display","author":"Cabrera D.","year":"2007"},{"key":"bibr7-1029864917704033","first-page":"1467","volume-title":"Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia Conference","author":"Cannam C.","year":"2010"},{"issue":"11","key":"bibr8-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1526","DOI":"10.1002/asi.20429","volume":"57","author":"Dubnov S.","year":"2006","journal-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology"},{"issue":"3","key":"bibr9-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"307","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.30.3.307","volume":"30","author":"Eerola T.","year":"2013","journal-title":"Music Perception"},{"issue":"4","key":"bibr10-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"387","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.29.4.387","volume":"29","author":"Farbood M.

in music since the 1950’s and yet many questions about its perception remain unanswered. Approaching sound mass from the perspective of auditory scene analysis, we define it as a type of auditory grouping that retains an impression of multiplicity even as it is perceived as a perceptual unit. Sound mass requires all markers of the individual identities of sounds to be deemphasized to prevent them from splitting off into separate streams. Seeking to determine how consistent listeners are in their perception of sound mass, and whether it is possible to determine sound parameters and threshold values that predict sound mass perception, we conducted two perceptual studies on Ligeti’s Continuum. This piece consists of an extremely rapid, steady stream of eighth-note dyads with no tempo changes. We addressed the claim by Ligeti and others that the fusion into a continuous texture or sound mass occurs at ca. 20 attacks/s, hypothesizing that other factors such as pitch organization, emergent rhythm, timbre, and register would affect this value. A variety of factors were found to affect sound mass perception, suggesting that the threshold value is not absolute but varies according to principles of auditory scene analysis.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2016.33.3.287","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,8]],"date-time":"2016-02-08T22:42:31Z","timestamp":1454971351000},"page":"287-305","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Auditory Scene Analysis and the Perception of Sound Mass in Ligeti’s Continuum"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"33","author":[{"given":"Chelsea","family":"Douglas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Jason","family":"Noble","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/33/3/287/191095/mp_2016_33_3_287.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/33/3/287/191095/mp_2016_33_3_287.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]],"date-time":"2020-10-12T21:46:38Z","timestamp":1602539198000},"score":17.650658,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/33/3/287/62668/Auditory-Scene-Analysis-and-the-Perception-of"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2016.33.3.287","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"mtIDs":[343,322,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]],"date-time":"2022-04-06T00:06:55Z","timestamp":1649203615570},"reference-count":59,"publisher":"Cambridge University Press (CUP)","issue":"2","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]],"date-time":"2020-08-06T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1596672000000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":5,"URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["cambridge.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Org.

Whereas music performed by humans is necessarily constrained by certain temporal limits that define human information processing and embodiment, machines are capable of producing sound with scales and structures of time that reach potentially very far outside of these human limitations. But even musics produced with superhuman means are still subject to human constraints in music perception and cognition. Focusing on five principles of auditory perception – segmentation, grouping, pulse, metre and repetition – we hypothesise that musics that exceed or subvert the thresholds that define ‘human time’ are likely to be recognised by listeners as expressing timelessness. To support this hypothesis, we report an experiment in which a listening panel reviewed excerpts of electroacoustic music selected for their temporally subversive or excessive properties, and rated them (1) for the pace of time they express (normative, speeding up, or slowing down), and (2) for whether or not the music expresses ‘timelessness’. We find that while the specific musical parameters associated with temporal phenomenology vary from one musical context to the next, a general trend obtains across musical contexts through the excess or subversion of a particular perceptual constraint by a given musical parameter on the one hand, and the subjective experiences of time and timelessness on the other.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/s135577182000014x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]],"date-time":"2020-08-06T13:34:37Z","timestamp":1596720877000},"page":"232-247","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/policypage","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Experiences of Time and Timelessness in Electroacoustic Music"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"25","author":[{"given":"Jason","family":"Noble","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Tanor","family":"Bonin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]]},"reference":[{"key":"S135577182000014X_ref50","unstructured":"Ligeti, G. 1968.

tonal music. Previous research suggests that the degree of repetitiveness of a line can determine its relative melodicity within a musical texture. Concordantly, musical accompaniments tend to be highly repetitive, probably facilitating listeners’ tendency to focus on and follow the melodic lines they support. With the aim of contributing to the unexplored area of the relationship between repetition and attention in polyphonic music listening, this paper presents an empirical investigation of the way listeners attend to exact and immediate reiterations of musical fragments in two-part contrapuntal textures. Participants heard original excerpts composed of a repetitive and a nonrepetitive part, continuously rating the relative prominence of the two voices. The results indicate that the line that consists of immediate and exact repetitions of a short musical fragment tends to perceptually decrease in salience for the listener. This suggests that musical repetition plays a significant role in dynamically shaping listeners’ perceptions of musical texture by affecting the relative perceived importance of simultaneous parts.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2016.33.3.306","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,8]],"date-time":"2016-02-08T22:42:31Z","timestamp":1454971351000},"page":"306-318","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Effects of Repetition on Attention in Two-Part Counterpoint"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"33","author":[{"given":"Cecilia","family":"Taher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"René","family":"Rusch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/33/3/306/191104/mp_2016_33_3_306.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/33/3/306/191104/mp_2016_33_3_306.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]],"date-time":"2020-10-01T19:51:54Z","timestamp":1601581914000},"score":17.636133,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/33/3/306/62673/Effects-of-Repetition-on-Attention-in-TwoPart"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2016.33.3.306","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"mtIDs":[348,347,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]],"date-time":"2022-04-05T11:04:10Z","timestamp":1649156650822},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Acoustical Society of America (ASA)","issue":"S1","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1990,5]]},"DOI":"10.1121/1.2028062","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,10,13]],"date-time":"2005-10-13T19:34:09Z","timestamp":1129232049000},"page":"S157-S157","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Within‐ and cross‐channel mechanisms in the detection of frequency modulation coherence and incoherence"],"prefix":"10.1121","volume":"87","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Cécile M.

Psychol."],"abstract":"<jats:p>Two experiments were conducted for the derivation of psychophysical scales of the following audio descriptors: spectral centroid, spectral spread, spectral skewness, odd-to-even harmonic ratio, spectral deviation, and spectral slope. The stimulus sets of each audio descriptor were synthesized and (wherever possible) independently controlled through appropriate synthesis techniques. Partition scaling methods were used in both experiments, and the scales were constructed by fitting well-behaving functions to the listeners' ratings. In the first experiment, the listeners' task was the estimation of the relative differences between successive levels of a particular audio descriptor. The median values of listeners' ratings increased with increasing feature values, which confirmed listeners' abilities to estimate intervals. However, there was a large variability in the reliability of the derived interval scales depending on the stimulus spacing in each trial. In the second experiment, listeners had control over the stimulus values and were asked to divide the presented range of values into perceptually equal intervals, which provides a ratio scale. For every descriptor, the reliability of the derived ratio scales was excellent. The unit of a particular ratio scale was assigned empirically so as to facilitate qualitative comparisons between the scales of all audio descriptors. The construction of psychophysical scales based on univariate stimuli allowed for the establishment of cause-and-effect relations between audio descriptors and perceptual dimensions, contrary to past research that has relied on multivariate stimuli and has only examined the correlations between the two. Most importantly, this study provides an understanding of the ways in which the sensation magnitudes of several audio descriptors are apprehended.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835401","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T19:23:47Z","timestamp":1648668227000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Interval and Ratio Scaling of Spectral Audio Descriptors"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Savvas","family":"Kazazis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"1892","DOI":"10.3758/s13414-017-1394-6","article-title":"Brightness scaling of periodic tones","volume":"79","author":"Almeida","year":"2017","journal-title":"Attent.

affects the formation of similarity relations among motivic/thematic materials during listening, and that three contextual aspects, namely contrasts in surface features and the organization and development of the musical materials, shape the listening experience of complete works. We empirically investigate the effects of these three contextual aspects on the perceived similarity of motivic variations while listening to Boulez's Anthèmes. This piece exists in two versions: 1) solo violin, and 2) violin and electronics. They contain clear categories of motivic materials, whose recognition can be studied within the natural contexts of the two versions. In Experiment 1, participants freely classified motivic variations extracted from Anthèmes 1 representing different motivic categories. In Experiment 2, participants provided dissimilarity ratings for these variations. From these results, motivic models were selected for each category. In Experiment 3, musicians identified variations of the models while listening to either version of Anthèmes. The results indicate that musical contexts that are more contrasting on the surface, or more predictable in terms of motivic features and organization, facilitate the identification of motivic variations, whereas the overall formal development of the musical materials and their context over time disturbs the recognition of those variations.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.36.1.77","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,21]],"date-time":"2018-08-21T22:35:21Z","timestamp":1534890921000},"page":"77-97","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effects of Musical Context on the Recognition of Musical Motives During Listening"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"36","author":[{"given":"Cecilia","family":"Taher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Robert","family":"Hasegawa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"2020093020342610000_r1","unstructured":"For participants listening to Anthèmes 1, each of these five blocks was itself performed three times, using the same stimuli, so that participants completed the same tasks with the stimuli belonging to one motivic family three times in direct succession.

Statistical tests (ANOVA and logistic regression) suggested that listening to Anthèmes several times did not affect the listeners’ recognition of the motivic variations. We believe that this apparent lack of effect of repeated exposure on motivic recognition was largely due to a global effect of repeated exposure across the entire experiment, during which participants heard the piece a total of 15 times one after the other. Because the present paper does not deal with the effects of repeated exposure to the same piece of music, only the data corresponding to the first listening associated with each motivic family are reported and discussed here.

between music analysis, performance, and tension perception. Part 1 examines harpsichordists’ analyses and performances of an unmeasured prelude—a semi-improvisatory genre open to interpretive freedom. Twelve harpsichordists performed the Prélude non mesuré No. 7 by Louis Couperin on a harpsichord equipped with a MIDI console and submitted a formal analysis. Using a curve-fitting approach, we investigated the correspondence between analyzed segmentations and group-final lengthening. We found that harpsichordists also employed “group-final anticipation,” involving deceleration before, and acceleration through, analyzed boundaries. In Part 2, three listener groups (harpsichordists, musicians, and nonmusicians) continuously rated tension for 12 performances. In contrast to measured music, local tension peaks, rather than troughs, occurred at boundaries featuring group-final lengthening. Associations were found between global tempo and tension ratings, with significant differences among the three listener groups. Performers expressed the large-scale structure through the amount of tempo variability, which was also reflected in tension rating variability.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2016.34.1.1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]],"date-time":"2016-09-07T19:12:44Z","timestamp":1473275564000},"page":"1-20","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Analysis, Performance, and Tension Perception of an Unmeasured Prelude for Harpsichord"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"34","author":[{"given":"Meghan","family":"Goodchild","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Bruno","family":"Gingras","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/34/1/1/191360/mp_2016_34_1_1.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/34/1/1/191360/mp_2016_34_1_1.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]],"date-time":"2020-10-12T22:00:36Z","timestamp":1602540036000},"score":17.58958,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/34/1/1/62767/Analysis-Performance-and-Tension-Perception-of-an"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2016.34.1.1","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"mtIDs":[317,300,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,14]],"date-time":"2022-04-14T04:26:50Z","timestamp":1649910410503},"publisher-location":"Cham","reference-count":63,"publisher":"Springer International Publishing","isbn-type":[{"value":"9783030148317","type":"print"},{"value":"9783030148324","type":"electronic"}],"license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]],"date-time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1546300800000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.springer.com/tdm"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]],"date-time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1546300800000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.springer.com/tdm"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-14832-4_1","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]],"date-time":"2019-05-07T16:26:35Z","timestamp":1557246395000},"page":"1-19","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["The Present, Past, and Future of Timbre Research"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[{"given":"Kai","family":"Siedenburg","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Charalampos","family":"Saitis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"reference":[{"key":"1_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"610","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuron.2010.04.014","volume":"66","author":"TR Agus","year":"2010","unstructured":"Agus TR, Thorpe SJ, Pressnitzer D (2010) Rapid formation of robust auditory memories: insights from noise.

It relates to the auditory fusion of simultaneous sounds and can be linked to several acoustic factors (e.g., temporal synchrony, harmonicity, spectral relationships). Previous research has left unanswered if and how musicians control these factors during performance to achieve blend. For instance, timbral adjustments could be oriented towards the leading performer. In order to study such adjustments, pairs of one bassoon and one horn player participated in a performance experiment, which involved several musical and acoustical factors. Performances were evaluated through acoustic measures and behavioral ratings, investigating differences across performer roles as leaders or followers, unison or non-unison intervals, and earlier or later segments of performances. In addition, the acoustical influence of performance room and communication impairment were also investigated. Role assignments affected spectral adjustments in that musicians acting as followers adjusted toward a “darker” timbre (i.e., realized by reducing the frequencies of the main formant or spectral centroid). Notably, these adjustments occurred together with slight reductions in sound level, although this was more apparent for horn than bassoon players. Furthermore, coordination seemed more critical in unison performances and also improved over the course of a performance. These findings compare to similar dependencies found concerning how performers coordinate their timing and suggest that performer roles also determine the nature of adjustments necessary to achieve the common aim of a blended timbre.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2017.35.2.144","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,14]],"date-time":"2017-11-14T00:00:22Z","timestamp":1510617622000},"page":"144-164","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Blending Between Bassoon and Horn Players"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"35","author":[{"given":"Sven-Amin","family":"Lembke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Scott","family":"Levine","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/2/144/274103/mp_2017_35_2_144.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/2/144/274103/mp_2017_35_2_144.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]],"date-time":"2020-10-01T19:07:02Z","timestamp":1601579222000},"score":16.885717,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/35/2/144/92021/Blending-Between-Bassoon-and-Horn-PlayersAn"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2017.35.2.144","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"mtIDs":[355,331,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]],"date-time":"2022-04-04T18:37:43Z","timestamp":1649097463234},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"ASA","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"DOI":"10.1121/1.4800054","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,22]],"date-time":"2013-03-22T18:46:07Z","timestamp":1363977967000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Predicting blend between orchestral timbres using generalized spectral-envelope descriptions"],"prefix":"10.1121","author":[{"given":"Sven-Amin","family":"Lembke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Eugene","family":"Narmour","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"231","event":{"name":"ICA 2013 Montreal","location":"Montreal, Canada"},"container-title":["Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,27]],"date-time":"2017-01-27T15:56:15Z","timestamp":1485532575000},"score":16.885717,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4800054"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4800054","ISSN":["1939-800X"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1939-800X","type":"print"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"mtIDs":[356,331,159]},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T09:25:16Z","timestamp":1648891516149},"reference-count":62,"publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000038","name":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["RGPIN 312774"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100001804","name":"Canada Research Chairs","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["950-223484"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["frontiersin.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Front.

Koechlin also provides volume rankings for orchestral instruments in different registers. Studies show that humans, as well as several animal species, perceive extensity for many sound sources, but none has demonstrated its relevance for musical instruments from different families. To test extensity, samples of seven orchestral instruments equalized in pitch, but not in loudness, were used. Task 1 required participants to order eight sets of samples on a largeness (grosseur) scale from “less large” ( moins gros) to “larger” ( plus gros). Task 2 required them to quantify the sounds’ largeness compared to a reference sample on a ratio scale. Both studies show that participants share a common extensity perception for instrument timbres of different families that is very similar to Koechlin’s proposed scale. This perception seems to be related to spectral shape and particularly to acoustic energy in the lower frequencies. Perception of this attribute is unrelated to musical training, native language, and the presence of minor hearing loss, which suggests that extensity could be a universal attribute of timbre perception that is useful in orchestration practice and theory. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177/1029864916649638","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,15]],"date-time":"2016-06-15T12:39:20Z","timestamp":1465994360000},"page":"113-131","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Koechlin’s <i>volume</i>: Perception of sound extensity among instrument timbres from different families"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"21","author":[{"given":"Frédéric","family":"Chiasson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Université de Montréal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Caroline","family":"Traube","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Université de Montréal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Clément","family":"Lagarrigue","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Université de Montréal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-1029864916649638","volume-title":"The study of orchestration","author":"Adler S.","year":"2002","edition":"3"},{"key":"bibr2-1029864916649638","volume-title":"Zur Psychologie der Toneigenschaften","author":"Albersheim G.","year":"1939"},{"key":"bibr4-1029864916649638","volume-title":"Instrumentation and orchestration","author":"Blatter A.","year":"1997","edition":"2"},{"key":"bibr5-1029864916649638","first-page":"29","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Auditory Display","author":"Cabrera D.","year":"2003"},{"key":"bibr6-1029864916649638","first-page":"397","volume-title":"Charles Koechlin: Compositeur et humaniste","author":"Chiasson F.","year":"2010"},{"key":"bibr7-1029864916649638","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1121/1.2338295"},{"key":"bibr8-1029864916649638","volume-title":"Sound structure in music","author":"Erickson R.","year":"1975"},{"key":"bibr9-1029864916649638","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1121/1.421048"},{"key":"bibr11-1029864916649638","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1121/1.2149839"},{"key":"bibr12-1029864916649638","first-page":"253","volume-title":"Perception and cognition of music","author":"Hajda J.

Composers and scholars describe sound mass with many semantic associations. We designed an experiment to evaluate to what extent these associations are experienced by other listeners. Thirty-eight participants heard 40 excerpts of sound mass music and related contemporary genres and rated them along batteries of semantic scales. Participants also described their rating strategies for some categories. A combination of qualitative stimulus analyses, Cronbach’s alpha tests, and principal component analyses suggest that cross-domain mappings between semantic categories and musical properties are statistically coherent between participants, implying non-arbitrary relations. Some aspects of participants’ descriptions of their rating strategies appear to be reflected in their numerical ratings. We sought quantitative bases for these associations in the acoustic signals. After attempts to correlate semantic ratings with classical audio descriptors failed, we pursued a neuromimetic representation called spectrotemporal modulations (STMs), which explains much more of the variance in semantic ratings. This result suggests that semantic interpretations of music may involve qualities or attributes that are objectively present in the music, since computer simulation can use sound signals to partially reconstruct human semantic ratings.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2020.38.2.214","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,5]],"date-time":"2020-12-05T06:53:11Z","timestamp":1607151191000},"page":"214-242","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Semantic Dimensions of Sound Mass Music"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Jason","family":"Noble","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Etienne","family":"Thoret","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Max","family":"Henry","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"2020120422590767100_ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Bello, J.

Thirty-four subsections from the five themes of The Angel of Death by Roger Reynolds were composed identically for piano (Expt. 1) and chamber orchestra (Expt. 2) in terms of pitch, rhythm, and dynamics. Listeners were asked to group together those judged to be musically similar and to describe the similarities between the subsections in each group. Listeners based their classifications on surface similarities related to tempo, rhythmic and melodic texture, pitch register, melodic contour, and articulation. They were to some extent also based on similarity of the mood evoked by the excerpts. This latter factor was more prominent in the verbalizations for the orchestral version. Instrumentation, timbre, and type of timbral change (smooth, disjunctive) also affected classifications in the orchestral version. Perceptual relations among thematic materials within the piece and the interaction of form-bearing dimensions in musical similarity perception are discussed.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2004.22.2.207","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,11,22]],"date-time":"2004-11-22T23:31:47Z","timestamp":1101166307000},"page":"207-237","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":24,"title":["Perception of Musical Similarity Among Contemporary Thematic Materials in Two Instrumentations"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"22","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"CIRMMT, Faculty of Music, McGill University, 555 rue Sherbrooke ouest, Montr�al, Qu�bec, Canada H3A 1E3 (e-mail: smc@music.mcgill.ca"}],"isLabHead":true},{"given":"Sandrine","family":"Vieillard","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CIRMMT, Faculty of Music, McGill University, 555 rue Sherbrooke ouest, Montr�al, Qu�bec, Canada H3A 1E3 (e-mail: smc@music.mcgill.ca"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Olivier","family":"Houix","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CIRMMT, Faculty of Music, McGill University, 555 rue Sherbrooke ouest, Montr�al, Qu�bec, Canada H3A 1E3 (e-mail: smc@music.mcgill.ca"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Roger","family":"Reynolds","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CIRMMT, Faculty of Music, McGill University, 555 rue Sherbrooke ouest, Montr�al, Qu�bec, Canada H3A 1E3 (e-mail: smc@music.mcgill.ca"}],"isLabHead":false}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"31","DOI":"10.1177/102986490000400102","volume":"4","author":"Addessi A.","year":"2000","journal-title":"Musicae Scientiae"},{"key":"p_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0096-1523.6.3.501"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/0305735690181004"},{"key":"p_4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/BF01202582"},{"key":"p_5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080/07494468900640301"},{"key":"p_6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/0305735690181003"},{"key":"p_7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/40285753"},{"key":"p_8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/40285794"},{"key":"p_9","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","volume-title":"Classification and cognition","author":"Estes W.

Our aim is to investigate the influence of timbre on the perception of affect conveyed by Western and Chinese classical music using a cross-cultural approach. Four listener groups (Western musicians, Western nonmusicians, Chinese musicians, and Chinese nonmusicians; 40 per group) were presented with 48 musical excerpts, which included two musical excerpts (one piece of Chinese and one piece of Western classical music) per affect quadrant from the valence-arousal space, representing angry, happy, peaceful, and sad emotions and played with six different instruments (<jats:italic>erhu</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>dizi</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>pipa</jats:italic>, violin, flute, and guitar). Participants reported ratings of valence, tension arousal, energy arousal, preference, and familiarity on continuous scales ranging from 1 to 9. ANOVA reveals that participants’ cultural backgrounds have a greater impact on affect perception than their musical backgrounds, and musicians more clearly distinguish between a perceived measure (valence) and a felt measure (preference) than do nonmusicians. We applied linear partial least squares regression to explore the relation between affect perception and acoustic features. The results show that the important acoustic features for valence and energy arousal are similar, which are related mostly to spectral variation, the shape of the temporal envelope, and the dynamic range. The important acoustic features for tension arousal describe the shape of the spectral envelope, noisiness, and the shape of the temporal envelope. The explanation for the similarity of perceived affect ratings between instruments is the similar acoustic features that were caused by the physical characteristics of specific instruments and performing techniques.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.732865","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]],"date-time":"2021-09-29T07:37:41Z","timestamp":1632901061000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Influence of Timbre on Affect Perception in Western Classical Music and Chinese Music Traditions"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Xin","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Yujia","family":"Wei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Lena","family":"Heng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"143","DOI":"10.3390/app6050143","article-title":"A review of physical and perceptual feature extraction techniques for speech, music and environmental sounds","volume":"6","author":"Alías","year":"2016","journal-title":"Appl.

This involves a set of factors that this study jointly assesses by correlating the perceptual degree of blend with the underlying acoustical characteristics. Perceptual blend ratings from two experiments were considered, with the stimuli consisting of: 1) dyads of wind instruments at unison and minor-third intervals and at two pitch levels, and 2) triads of wind and string instruments, including bowed and plucked string excitation. The correlational analysis relied on partial least-squares regression, as this technique is not restricted by the number and collinearity of regressors. The regressors encompassed acoustical descriptors of timbre (spectral, temporal, and spectrotemporal), as well as acoustical descriptors accounting for pitch and articulation. From regressor loadings in principal-components space, the major regressors leading to substantial and orthogonal contributions were identified. The regression models explained around 90% of the variance in the datasets, which was achievable with less than a third of all regressors considered initially. Blend seemed to be influenced by differences across intervals, pitch, and articulation. Unison intervals yielded more blend than did non-unison intervals, and the presence of plucked strings resulted in clearly lower blend ratings than for sustained instrument combinations. Furthermore, prominent spectral features of instrument combinations influenced perceived blend. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177/1029864917731806","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,31]],"date-time":"2017-10-31T12:02:49Z","timestamp":1509451369000},"page":"250-274","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Acoustical correlates of perceptual blend in timbre dyads and triads"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"23","author":[{"given":"Sven-Amin","family":"Lembke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Kyra","family":"Parker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Eugene","family":"Narmour","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"}],"isLabHead":false},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"isLabHead":true}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,31]]},"reference":[{"issue":"3","key":"bibr1-1029864917731806","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"251","DOI":"10.1016/0169-7439(93)85002-X","volume":"18","author":"de Jong S","year":"1993","journal-title":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems"},{"key":"bibr2-1029864917731806","first-page":"621","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 10th International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference","author":"Eerola T.","year":"2009"},{"key":"bibr3-1029864917731806","volume-title":"Acoustic theory of speech production","author":"Fant G.","year":"1960"},{"key":"bibr4-1029864917731806","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1","DOI":"10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9","volume":"185","author":"Geladi P.","year":"1986","journal-title":"Analytica Chimica Acta"},{"issue":"2","key":"bibr5-1029864917731806","first-page":"462","volume":"36","author":"Giordano B.

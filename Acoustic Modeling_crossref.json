Psychol."],"abstract":"<jats:p>Technological advances over the past 50 years or so have resulted in the development of a succession of hardware and software systems intended to improve the quality and effectiveness of Western music instrument pedagogy during classroom instruction or individual study. These systems have aimed to provide evaluation or visualization of single or combined technical aspects by analyzing performance data collected in real time or offline. The number of such educational technologies shows an ever-increasing trend over time, aided by the wide diffusion and availability of mobile devices. However, we believe there are unrealized opportunities for modern technologies to help music students in their technical development and assist them during their practice sessions in between visits to their teachers. The ubiquity of PCs and mobile devices with built-in microphones, speakers, and cameras has inspired the development of media technologies in support of music pedagogy. They offer an attractive potential for implementing audio signal processing algorithms addressing different technical skills of the performer, providing real-time feedback, collecting data over time, and applying statistical models. Despite this potential, most available software for music instrument pedagogy remains very limited in functionality. This study provides a survey of music edTech software available, together with the methods of use, addressed technical skills, commonalities, and limitations. Results show that most current software is based on the metronome and tuner, with only a few systems that have limited abilities to follow a performance in real-time and compare it to a given score to monitor correctness of notes, intonation, and rhythm. The survey also highlights a high and under-exploited potential regarding the monitoring of other more specific technical skills, which are more instrument-dependent, but no less important, such as the control of dynamic range and clarity of the attack. This article ends with a discussion of possible directions for future development of technologies to support the practice of music students at different levels, with some consideration for the corresponding signal processing methods that can be utilized or that need advancement. By helping students to more efficiently achieve a high level of proficiency of their instruments with assistive technologies, we hope to minimize stress and afford better enjoyment of the music performance experience for all.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835609","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]],"date-time":"2022-03-28T16:17:48Z","timestamp":1648484268000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Current State and Future Directions of Technologies for Music Instrument Pedagogy"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Alberto","family":"Acquilino","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gary","family":"Scavone","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,22]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","volume-title":"Music Apps for Musicians and Music Teachers","author":"Axford","year":"2015"},{"key":"B2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"303","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-23807-0_25","article-title":"Instrumentor: An interactive robot for musical instrument tutoring","volume-title":"20th Annual Conference on Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems","author":"Bagga","year":"2019"},{"key":"B3","first-page":"414","article-title":"Good-sounds.org: a framework to explore goodness in instrumental sounds","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 17th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference","author":"Bandiera","year":"2016"},{"key":"B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"694","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730810.013.0042","article-title":"The changing face of individual instrumental tuition: value, purpose and potential","volume":"1","author":"Creech","year":"2012","journal-title":"Oxford Handb.

sounds of sustained contact interactions. This study aims to identify the most effective algorithm to create a realistic sound for rolling objects. In Experiment\n 1 and 2, participants were asked to rate the extent to which 6 different versions sounded like rolling sounds. Subsequently, in Experiment 3, participants compared the 6 versions best rated in Experiment 1 and 2, to the original recordings. Results are presented in terms of both statistical\n analysis of the most effective synthesis algorithm and qualitative user comments. On methodological grounds, the comparison of Experiments 1, 2 and 3 highlights major differences between judgments collected in reference to the original recordings as opposed to judgments based on memory representations\n of rolling

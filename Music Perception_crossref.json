This article presents a theory of melodic expectation based on that assertion, describes two computer models of aspects of that theory, and finds strong support for that theory in comparisons of the behavior of those models with the behavior of participants in several experiments. The following summary statement of the theory is explained and illustrated in the article: Experienced listeners of tonal music expect completions in which the musical forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia control operations on alphabets in hierarchies of embellishment whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed shapes. A \"single-level\" computer program models the operation of these musical forces on a single level of musical structure. Given a melodic beginning in a certain key, the model not only produces almost the same responses as experimental participants, but it also rates them in a similar way; the computer model gives higher ratings to responses that participants sing more often. In fact, the completions generated by this model match note-for-note the entire completions sung by participants in several psychological studies as often as the completions of any one of those participants matches those of the other participants. A \"multilevel\" computer program models the operation of these musical forces on multiple hierarchical levels. When the multilevel model is given a melodic beginning and a hierarchical description of its embellishment structure (i.e., a Schenkerian analysis of it), the model produces responses that reflect the operation of musical forces on all the levels of that hierarchical structure. Statistical analyses of the results of a number of experiments test hypotheses arising from the computer models' algorithm (S. Larson, 1993a) for the interaction of musical forces as well as from F. Lerdahl's similar (1996) algorithm. Further statistical analysis contrasts the explanatory power of the theory of musical forces with that of E. Narmour's (1990, 1992) implication-realization model. The striking agreement between computer-generated responses and experimental results suggests that the theory captures some important aspects of melodic expectation. Furthermore, the fact that these data can be modeled well by the interaction of constantly acting but contextually determined musical forces gives support to the idea that we experience musical motions metaphorically in terms of our experience of physical motions.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2004.21.4.457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,5,28]],"date-time":"2004-05-28T16:33:17Z","timestamp":1085761997000},"page":"457-498","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":41,"title":["Musical Forces and Melodic Expectations: Comparing Computer Models and Experimental Results"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"21","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Oregon, School of Music, 1225 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1225; e-mail: steve@uoregon.edu"}]}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_2","unstructured":"Aksnes, H.

This chapter will outline connections between the orchestration practices of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and perceptual principles based on recent research in auditory scene analysis and timbre perception. Analyses of orchestration treatises and musical scores reveal an implicit understanding of auditory grouping principles by which many orchestral effects and techniques function. We will explore how concurrent grouping cues result in blended combinations of instruments, how sequential grouping into segregated melodies or stratified (foreground and background) layers is influenced by timbral similarities and dissimilarities, and how segmental grouping cues create formal boundaries and expressive gestural shaping through changes in instrumental textures. This exploration will be framed within an examination of historical and contemporary discussion of orchestral effects and techniques.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190637224.013.10","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,7]],"date-time":"2018-06-07T14:51:28Z","timestamp":1528383088000},"page":"495-524","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Perceptual Processes in Orchestration"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Meghan","family":"Goodchild","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,7]]},"container-title":["The Oxford Handbook of Timbre"],"original-title":["Perceptual Processes in Orchestration"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,14]],"date-time":"2021-10-14T14:15:28Z","timestamp":1634220928000},"score":19.838455,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190637224.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190637224-e-10"}},"editor":[{"given":"Emily I.","family":"Dolan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alexander","family":"Rehding","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,7]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190637224.013.10","published":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,7]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]],"date-time":"2022-03-29T14:04:48Z","timestamp":1648562688659},"reference-count":34,"publisher":"University of California Press","issue":"2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,1]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>perception of instrumental blend is important for understanding aspects of orchestration, but no work has studied blends of impulsive and sustained instruments. The first experiment identified the factors that influence the rating of blendedness of dyads formed of one sustained sound and one impulsive sound. Longer attack times and lower spectral centroids increased blend. The contribution of the impulsive sound’s properties to the degree of blend was greater than that of the sustained sound. The second experiment determined the factors that influence similarity ratings among dyads. The mean spectral envelope and the attack time of the dyad best explained the dissimilarity ratings. However, contrary to the first experiment, the spectral envelope of the sustained sound was more important than that of the impulsive sound. Multidimensional scaling of dissimilarity ratings on blended dyads yielded one dimension correlated with the attack time of the dyad and another dimension whose spectral correlate was different for two different clusters within the space, spectral spread for one and spectral flatness for the other, suggesting a combined categorical-analogical organization of the second dimension.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.30.2.117","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,11]],"date-time":"2012-12-11T18:39:53Z","timestamp":1355251193000},"page":"117-128","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Perception of Dyads of Impulsive and Sustained Instrument Sounds"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"30","author":[{"given":"Damien","family":"Tardieu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"IRCAM-STMS-CNRS, Paris, France"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montréal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"p_1","unstructured":"ballet, g. & borghesi, r.

In this study, empathy is tested as a possible moderator between recognition and induction that is, on its own, moderated via music preference evaluations and other individual and situational features. Preference was also tested to determine whether it had an effect on measures of emotion independently from emotional expression. A web-based experiment gathered from 3,164 music listeners emotion, empathy, and preference ratings in a between-subjects design embedded in a music-personality test. Stimuli were a sample of 23 musical excerpts (each 30 seconds long, five randomly assigned to each participant) from various musical styles chosen to represent different emotions and preferences. Listeners in the recognition rating condition rated measures of valence and arousal significantly differently than listeners in the felt rating condition. Empathy ratings were shown to modulate this relationship: when empathy was present, the difference between the two rating types was reduced. Furthermore, we confirmed preference as one major predictor of empathy ratings. Emotional contagion was tested and confirmed as an additional direct effect of emotional expression on induced emotions. This study is among the first to explicitly test empathy and emotional contagion during music listening, helping to explain the often-reported emotional response to music in everyday life.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2013.31.2.139","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,5]],"date-time":"2013-12-05T22:40:50Z","timestamp":1386283250000},"page":"139-156","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":58,"title":["Empathy and Emotional Contagion as a Link Between Recognized and Felt Emotions in Music Listening"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"31","author":[{"given":"Hauke","family":"Egermann","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Technische Universität Berlin, Germany"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/j.jml.2007.12.005"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2010.03.013"},{"key":"p_4","volume-title":"Sentics - The touch of emotions","author":"CLYNES M."},{"issue":"8","key":"p_5","first-page":"103","volume":"12","author":"COLOMBETTI G.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Journal of Consciousness Studies"},{"key":"p_6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/1534582304267187"},{"key":"p_7","unstructured":"EEROLA, T., LARTILLOT, O. & TOIVIAINEN, P.

Determining when changes in these reactions tend to manifest themselves can help us understand how and why. Activity Analysis quantifies alignment of response events across listeners and listenings through continuous responses to musical works. Its coordination tests allow us to determine if there is enough inter-response coherence to merit linking their summary time series to the musical event structure and to identify moments of exceptional alignment in response events. In this paper, we apply Activity Analysis to continuous ratings from several music experiments, using this wealth of data to compare its performance with that of statistics used in previous studies. We compare the Coordination Scores and nonparametric measures of local activity coordination to other coherence measures, including those derived from correlations and Cronbach’s α. Activity Analysis reveals the variation in coordination of participants’ responses for different musical works, picks out moments of coordination in response to different interpretations of the same music, and demonstrates that responses along the two dimensions in continuous 2D rating tasks can be independent.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.35.3.253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,12]],"date-time":"2018-01-12T23:45:11Z","timestamp":1515800711000},"page":"253-294","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Activity Analysis and Coordination in Continuous Responses to Music"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"35","author":[{"given":"Finn","family":"Upham","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada & New York University"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/3/253/273867/mp_2018_35_3_253.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/3/253/273867/mp_2018_35_3_253.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]],"date-time":"2020-10-01T19:36:57Z","timestamp":1601581017000},"score":19.696281,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/35/3/253/91976/Activity-Analysis-and-Coordination-in-Continuous"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2018.35.3.253","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2018,2]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,3]],"date-time":"2022-04-03T04:14:09Z","timestamp":1648959249811},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Informa UK Limited","issue":"1","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Contemporary Music Review"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]},"DOI":"10.1080/07494468900640161","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,6,27]],"date-time":"2006-06-27T14:13:46Z","timestamp":1151417626000},"page":"vii-ix","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Preface"],"prefix":"10.1080","volume":"4","author":[{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Irène","family":"Deliège","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"301","container-title":["Contemporary Music Review"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07494468900640161","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,12]],"date-time":"2016-12-12T21:52:53Z","timestamp":1481579573000},"score":19.696281,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07494468900640161"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1080/07494468900640161"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07494468900640161","ISSN":["0749-4467","1477-2256"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0749-4467","type":"print"},{"value":"1477-2256","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published":{"date-parts":[[1989,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]],"date-time":"2022-04-05T09:48:18Z","timestamp":1649152098982},"reference-count":59,"publisher":"University of California Press","issue":"1","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>The goal of the current study was to explore outstanding questions in the field of timbre perception and cognition—specifically, whether memory for timbre is better in trained musicians or in nonmusicians, whether short-term timbre recognition is invariant to pitch differences, and whether timbre dissimilarity influences timbre recognition performance. Four experiments examined short-term recognition of musical timbre using a serial recognition task in which listeners indicated whether the orders of the timbres of two subsequently presented sound sequences were identical or not. Experiment 1 revealed significant effects of sequence length on recognition accuracy and an interaction of music training and pitch variability: musicians performed better for variable-pitch sequences, but did not differ from nonmusicians with constant-pitch sequences. Experiment 2 yielded a significant effect of pitch variability for musicians when pitch patterns varied between standard and comparison sequences. Experiment 3 high-lighted the impact of the timbral dissimilarity of swapped sounds and indicated a recency effect in timbre recognition. Experiment 4 confirmed the importance of the dissimilarity of the swap, but did not yield any pertinent role of timbral heterogeneity of the sequence. Further analyses confirmed the strong correlation of the timbral dissimilarity of swapped sounds with response behavior, accounting for around 90% of the variance in response choices across all four experiments. These results extend findings regarding the impact of music training and pitch variability from the literature on timbre perception to the domain of short-term memory and demonstrate the mnemonic importance of timbre similarity relations among sounds in sequences. The role of the factors of music training, pitch variability, and timbral similarity in music listening is discussed.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.36.1.24","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,21]],"date-time":"2018-08-21T22:35:21Z","timestamp":1534890921000},"page":"24-39","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Short-term Recognition of Timbre Sequences"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"36","author":[{"given":"Kai","family":"Siedenburg","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada & Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","reference":[{"issue":"3","key":"2020093015233673200_ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1371","DOI":"10.1121/1.4863269","article-title":"Symmetric interactions and interference between pitch and timbre","volume":"135","year":"2014","journal-title":"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America"},{"key":"2020093015233673200_ref2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Alluri, V., & Toiviainen, P.

multidimensional sensory attribute and as a carrier of perceptually useful information about the mechanics of the sound source. To date, research on musical timbre has focused on defining its acoustical correlates, whereas fragmentary evidence is available on the influence of mechanical parameters. We quantified the extent to which mechanical properties of the sound source are associated with structures in the data from published identification and dissimilarity-rating studies. We focus on two macroscopic mechanical properties: the musical instrument family and excitation type. Identification confusions are significantly more frequent for same-family instruments. With dissimilarity ratings, same-family or same-excitation tones are judged more similar and tend to occupy the same region of multidimensional-scaling spaces. As such, significant associations between the perception of musical timbre and the mechanics of the sound source emerge even when not explicitly demanded by the task.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2010.28.2.155","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,14]],"date-time":"2010-12-14T14:11:15Z","timestamp":1292335875000},"page":"155-168","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":21,"title":["Sound

Musical timbre is a combination of continuous perceptual dimensions and discrete features to which listeners are differentially sensitive. The continuous dimensions often have quantifiable acoustic correlates. The timbre-space representation is a powerful psychological model that allows predictions to be made about timbre perception in situations beyond those used to derive the model in the first place. Timbre can play a role in larger-scale movements of tension and relaxation and thus contribute to the expression inherent in musical form. Under conditions of high blend among instruments composing a vertical sonority, timbral roughness is a major component of musical tension. However, it strongly depends on the way auditory grouping processes have parsed the incoming acoustic information into events and streams.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199298457.013.0007","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,2,13]],"date-time":"2013-02-13T05:41:41Z","timestamp":1360734101000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["The

Previous research suggests that the degree of repetitiveness of a line can determine its relative melodicity within a musical texture. Concordantly, musical accompaniments tend to be highly repetitive, probably facilitating listeners’ tendency to focus on and follow the melodic lines they support. With the aim of contributing to the unexplored area of the relationship between repetition and attention in polyphonic music listening, this paper presents an empirical investigation of the way listeners attend to exact and immediate reiterations of musical fragments in two-part contrapuntal textures. Participants heard original excerpts composed of a repetitive and a nonrepetitive part, continuously rating the relative prominence of the two voices. The results indicate that the line that consists of immediate and exact repetitions of a short musical fragment tends to perceptually decrease in salience for the listener. This suggests that musical repetition plays a significant role in dynamically shaping listeners’ perceptions of musical texture by affecting the relative perceived importance of simultaneous

since the 1950’s and yet many questions about its perception remain unanswered. Approaching sound mass from the perspective of auditory scene analysis, we define it as a type of auditory grouping that retains an impression of multiplicity even as it is perceived as a perceptual unit. Sound mass requires all markers of the individual identities of sounds to be deemphasized to prevent them from splitting off into separate streams. Seeking to determine how consistent listeners are in their perception of sound mass, and whether it is possible to determine sound parameters and threshold values that predict sound mass perception, we conducted two perceptual studies on Ligeti’s Continuum. This piece consists of an extremely rapid, steady stream of eighth-note dyads with no tempo changes. We addressed the claim by Ligeti and others that the fusion into a continuous texture or sound mass occurs at ca. 20 attacks/s, hypothesizing that other factors such as pitch organization, emergent rhythm, timbre, and register would affect this value. A variety of factors were found to affect sound mass perception, suggesting that the threshold value is not absolute but varies according to principles of auditory scene analysis.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2016.33.3.287","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,8]],"date-time":"2016-02-08T22:42:31Z","timestamp":1454971351000},"page":"287-305","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Auditory

responses in listeners. However, there are few theories related to orchestration that would assist in interpreting these empirical findings. This article investigates listeners’ emotional responses to four types of orchestral gestures – large-scale timbral and textural changes that occur in a coordinated, goal-directed manner – through an exploratory experiment that collected continuous responses of emotional intensity for musician and nonmusician listeners. A time series regression analysis was used to predict changes in emotional responses by modeling changes in several musical features, including instrumental texture, spectral centroid, loudness, and tempo. We demonstrate the application of a new visualization tool that compiles the emotional intensity ratings with score-based and performance-based musical features for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results suggest that the response profiles differ for the four gestural types. Following the increasing growth of instrumental texture and loudness, the emotional intensity ratings climbed steadily for the gradual addition types. The ratings for the sudden addition gestures sharply increased in response to the rapid textural change, peaking toward the end of the excerpt. There was a slight tendency for musicians, but not nonmusicians, to anticipate the moment of sudden addition with heightened emotional responses. The responses to the reductive excerpts, both gradual and sudden, feature a plateau of lingering high emotional intensity, despite the decrease of other musical features. The visualization provided a method to observe the evolution of listeners’ emotional reactions in response to the orchestral gestures and assisted in interpreting the results of the time series regression analysis. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177/1029864917704033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,12]],"date-time":"2017-05-12T13:13:15Z","timestamp":1494594795000},"page":"25-49","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Exploring emotional responses to orchestral gestures"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"23","author":[{"given":"Meghan","family":"Goodchild","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}]},{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Wild","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Canada"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-1029864917704033","volume-title":"The study of orchestration","author":"Adler S.","year":"2002","edition":"3"},{"key":"bibr2-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"100","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2005.11.007","volume":"100","author":"Bigand E.","year":"2006","journal-title":"Cognition"},{"issue":"8","key":"bibr3-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1113","DOI":"10.1080/02699930500204250","volume":"19","author":"Bigand E.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Cognition and Emotion"},{"key":"bibr4-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"161","DOI":"10.1080/07494468708567057","volume":"2","author":"Boulez P.","year":"1987","journal-title":"Contemporary Music Review"},{"key":"bibr5-1029864917704033","first-page":"356","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Auditory Display","author":"Cabrera D.","year":"2007"},{"key":"bibr7-1029864917704033","first-page":"1467","volume-title":"Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia Conference","author":"Cannam C.","year":"2010"},{"issue":"11","key":"bibr8-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1526","DOI":"10.1002/asi.20429","volume":"57","author":"Dubnov S.","year":"2006","journal-title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology"},{"issue":"3","key":"bibr9-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"307","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.30.3.307","volume":"30","author":"Eerola T.","year":"2013","journal-title":"Music Perception"},{"issue":"4","key":"bibr10-1029864917704033","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"387","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2012.29.4.387","volume":"29","author":"Farbood M.

Whereas music performed by humans is necessarily constrained by certain temporal limits that define human information processing and embodiment, machines are capable of producing sound with scales and structures of time that reach potentially very far outside of these human limitations. But even musics produced with superhuman means are still subject to human constraints in music perception and cognition. Focusing on five principles of auditory perception – segmentation, grouping, pulse, metre and repetition – we hypothesise that musics that exceed or subvert the thresholds that define ‘human time’ are likely to be recognised by listeners as expressing timelessness. To support this hypothesis, we report an experiment in which a listening panel reviewed excerpts of electroacoustic music selected for their temporally subversive or excessive properties, and rated them (1) for the pace of time they express (normative, speeding up, or slowing down), and (2) for whether or not the music expresses ‘timelessness’. We find that while the specific musical parameters associated with temporal phenomenology vary from one musical context to the next, a general trend obtains across musical contexts through the excess or subversion of a particular perceptual constraint by a given musical parameter on the one hand, and the subjective experiences of time and timelessness on the other.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/s135577182000014x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]],"date-time":"2020-08-06T13:34:37Z","timestamp":1596720877000},"page":"232-247","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/policypage","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Experiences of Time and Timelessness in Electroacoustic Music"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"25","author":[{"given":"Jason","family":"Noble","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tanor","family":"Bonin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]]},"reference":[{"key":"S135577182000014X_ref50","unstructured":"Ligeti, G. 1968.

The stimulus sets of each audio descriptor were synthesized and (wherever possible) independently controlled through appropriate synthesis techniques. Partition scaling methods were used in both experiments, and the scales were constructed by fitting well-behaving functions to the listeners' ratings. In the first experiment, the listeners' task was the estimation of the relative differences between successive levels of a particular audio descriptor. The median values of listeners' ratings increased with increasing feature values, which confirmed listeners' abilities to estimate intervals. However, there was a large variability in the reliability of the derived interval scales depending on the stimulus spacing in each trial. In the second experiment, listeners had control over the stimulus values and were asked to divide the presented range of values into perceptually equal intervals, which provides a ratio scale. For every descriptor, the reliability of the derived ratio scales was excellent. The unit of a particular ratio scale was assigned empirically so as to facilitate qualitative comparisons between the scales of all audio descriptors. The construction of psychophysical scales based on univariate stimuli allowed for the establishment of cause-and-effect relations between audio descriptors and perceptual dimensions, contrary to past research that has relied on multivariate stimuli and has only examined the correlations between the two. Most importantly, this study provides an understanding of the ways in which the sensation magnitudes of several audio descriptors are apprehended.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835401","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]],"date-time":"2022-03-30T19:23:47Z","timestamp":1648668227000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Interval and Ratio Scaling of Spectral Audio Descriptors"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Savvas","family":"Kazazis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"1892","DOI":"10.3758/s13414-017-1394-6","article-title":"Brightness scaling of periodic tones","volume":"79","author":"Almeida","year":"2017","journal-title":"Attent.

context affects the formation of similarity relations among motivic/thematic materials during listening, and that three contextual aspects, namely contrasts in surface features and the organization and development of the musical materials, shape the listening experience of complete works. We empirically investigate the effects of these three contextual aspects on the perceived similarity of motivic variations while listening to Boulez's Anthèmes. This piece exists in two versions: 1) solo violin, and 2) violin and electronics. They contain clear categories of motivic materials, whose recognition can be studied within the natural contexts of the two versions. In Experiment 1, participants freely classified motivic variations extracted from Anthèmes 1 representing different motivic categories. In Experiment 2, participants provided dissimilarity ratings for these variations. From these results, motivic models were selected for each category. In Experiment 3, musicians identified variations of the models while listening to either version of Anthèmes. The results indicate that musical contexts that are more contrasting on the surface, or more predictable in terms of motivic features and organization, facilitate the identification of motivic variations, whereas the overall formal development of the musical materials and their context over time disturbs the recognition of those variations.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2018.36.1.77","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,21]],"date-time":"2018-08-21T22:35:21Z","timestamp":1534890921000},"page":"77-97","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effects of Musical Context on the Recognition of Musical Motives During Listening"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"36","author":[{"given":"Cecilia","family":"Taher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]},{"given":"Robert","family":"Hasegawa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","reference":[{"key":"2020093020342610000_r1","unstructured":"For participants listening to Anthèmes 1, each of these five blocks was itself performed three times, using the same stimuli, so that participants completed the same tasks with the stimuli belonging to one motivic family three times in direct succession.

Statistical tests (ANOVA and logistic regression) suggested that listening to Anthèmes several times did not affect the listeners’ recognition of the motivic variations. We believe that this apparent lack of effect of repeated exposure on motivic recognition was largely due to a global effect of repeated exposure across the entire experiment, during which participants heard the piece a total of 15 times one after the other.

Part 1 examines harpsichordists’ analyses and performances of an unmeasured prelude—a semi-improvisatory genre open to interpretive freedom. Twelve harpsichordists performed the Prélude non mesuré No. 7 by Louis Couperin on a harpsichord equipped with a MIDI console and submitted a formal analysis. Using a curve-fitting approach, we investigated the correspondence between analyzed segmentations and group-final lengthening. We found that harpsichordists also employed “group-final anticipation,” involving deceleration before, and acceleration through, analyzed boundaries. In Part 2, three listener groups (harpsichordists, musicians, and nonmusicians) continuously rated tension for 12 performances. In contrast to measured music, local tension peaks, rather than troughs, occurred at boundaries featuring group-final lengthening. Associations were found between global tempo and tension ratings, with significant differences among the three listener groups. Performers expressed the large-scale structure through the amount of tempo variability, which was also reflected in tension rating variability.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2016.34.1.1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,7]],"date-time":"2016-09-07T19:12:44Z","timestamp":1473275564000},"page":"1-20","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Analysis, Performance, and Tension Perception of an Unmeasured Prelude for Harpsichord"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"34","author":[{"given":"Meghan","family":"Goodchild","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]},{"given":"Bruno","family":"Gingras","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/34/1/1/191360/mp_2016_34_1_1.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/34/1/1/191360/mp_2016_34_1_1.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]],"date-time":"2020-10-12T22:00:36Z","timestamp":1602540036000},"score":17.560297,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/34/1/1/62767/Analysis-Performance-and-Tension-Perception-of-an"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2016.34.1.1","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,2]],"date-time":"2022-04-02T02:58:00Z","timestamp":1648868280170},"reference-count":62,"publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000038","name":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["RGPIN 312774"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100001804","name":"Canada Research Chairs","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["950-223484"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["frontiersin.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Front.

It relates to the auditory fusion of simultaneous sounds and can be linked to several acoustic factors (e.g., temporal synchrony, harmonicity, spectral relationships). Previous research has left unanswered if and how musicians control these factors during performance to achieve blend. For instance, timbral adjustments could be oriented towards the leading performer. In order to study such adjustments, pairs of one bassoon and one horn player participated in a performance experiment, which involved several musical and acoustical factors. Performances were evaluated through acoustic measures and behavioral ratings, investigating differences across performer roles as leaders or followers, unison or non-unison intervals, and earlier or later segments of performances. In addition, the acoustical influence of performance room and communication impairment were also investigated. Role assignments affected spectral adjustments in that musicians acting as followers adjusted toward a “darker” timbre (i.e., realized by reducing the frequencies of the main formant or spectral centroid). Notably, these adjustments occurred together with slight reductions in sound level, although this was more apparent for horn than bassoon players. Furthermore, coordination seemed more critical in unison performances and also improved over the course of a performance. These findings compare to similar dependencies found concerning how performers coordinate their timing and suggest that performer roles also determine the nature of adjustments necessary to achieve the common aim of a blended timbre.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2017.35.2.144","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,14]],"date-time":"2017-11-14T00:00:22Z","timestamp":1510617622000},"page":"144-164","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Blending Between Bassoon and Horn Players"],"prefix":"10.1525","volume":"35","author":[{"given":"Sven-Amin","family":"Lembke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]},{"given":"Scott","family":"Levine","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGill University, Montreal, Canada"}]}],"member":"408","container-title":["Music Perception"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/2/144/274103/mp_2017_35_2_144.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article-pdf/35/2/144/274103/mp_2017_35_2_144.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]],"date-time":"2020-10-01T19:07:02Z","timestamp":1601579222000},"score":16.82107,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/35/2/144/92021/Blending-Between-Bassoon-and-Horn-PlayersAn"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/mp.2017.35.2.144","ISSN":["0730-7829","1533-8312"],"issn-type":[{"value":"0730-7829","type":"print"},{"value":"1533-8312","type":"electronic"}],"subject":["Music"],"published-other":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]],"date-time":"2022-04-04T07:20:58Z","timestamp":1649056858619},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"ASA","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"DOI":"10.1121/1.4800054","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,22]],"date-time":"2013-03-22T18:46:07Z","timestamp":1363977967000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Predicting blend between orchestral timbres using generalized spectral-envelope descriptions"],"prefix":"10.1121","author":[{"given":"Sven-Amin","family":"Lembke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eugene","family":"Narmour","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stephen","family":"McAdams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"231","event":{"name":"ICA 2013 Montreal","location":"Montreal, Canada"},"container-title":["Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,27]],"date-time":"2017-01-27T15:56:15Z","timestamp":1485532575000},"score":16.82107,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4800054"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4800054","ISSN":["1939-800X"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1939-800X","type":"print"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2013]]}}],"items-per-page":20,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}

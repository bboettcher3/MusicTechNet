A variety of systems is currently available, ranging from optical, multi-camera (passive and/or active) infra-red systems and inertial systems (using orientation sensors) to electromagnetic trackers providing six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) measurement per marker/sensor. Recent advances in technology have made many of these systems more affordable, allowing access to a large research community. Music-related mocap applications include the tracking movements of solo or group, beginner, or expert performers and instruments for teaching performance skills, comparing movement strategies across performers, generating movement synthesis parameters in animation, and use in real-time music interaction. This chapter introduces the basic concepts behind motion capture, reviews the most common mocap technologies used in the study of music performance, and presents several examples of research, pedagogy, and artistic uses. Mocap of single acoustic instrument performances is reviewed, including violin, cello, piano, clarinet, timpani, and acoustic guitar, as well as examples of mocap of multiple instruments. Finally, we discuss the limitations of mocap and possible solutions to overcome them.</p>","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.013.30","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,13]],"date-time":"2022-04-13T08:49:42Z","timestamp":1649839782000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Motion Capture of Music Performances"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"container-title":["The Oxford Handbook of Music Performance, Volume 2"],"original-title":["Motion Capture of Music Performances"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,13]],"date-time":"2022-04-13T08:49:42Z","timestamp":1649839782000},"score":22.628534,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190058869-e-30"}},"editor":[{"given":"Gary E.","family":"McPherson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190058869.013.30","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,18]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]],"date-time":"2022-04-05T23:15:30Z","timestamp":1649200530293},"publisher-location":"Berlin, Heidelberg","reference-count":9,"publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","isbn-type":[{"value":"9783540436782","type":"print"},{"value":"9783540478737","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"DOI":"10.1007/3-540-47873-6_26","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,24]],"date-time":"2007-10-24T21:47:29Z","timestamp":1193262449000},"page":"241-253","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":41,"title":["Quantitative Analysis of Non-obvious Performer Gestures"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2002,5,7]]},"reference":[{"key":"26_CR1","unstructured":"C.

Augmented instruments are acoustic instruments onto which sensors have been mounted in order to provide extra sonic control variables. Trumpets make ideal candidates for augmentation because they have spare physical space on which to mount electronics and spare performer “bandwidth” with which to interact with the augmentations. </jats:p><jats:p> In this article, underlying concepts of augmented instrument design are discussed along with a review and discussion of twelve existing augmented trumpets and five projects related to mouthpiece augmentation. Common aspects to many of these examples are identified, such as the prevalence of idiosyncratic designs, the use of buttons placed at or near the left-hand playing position, and the focus on measuring or mimicking trumpet valves. Three existing approaches to valve sensing are compared, and a novel method for sensing valve position, based on linear variable differential transformers, is introduced. Based on the review and comparison, we created an example augmented trumpet that tests the feasibility of a modular design paradigm. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of this review of the state-of-the-art and our own research suggests future directions towards a better understanding of augmented trumpet design. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00185","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,26]],"date-time":"2013-09-26T18:51:12Z","timestamp":1380221472000},"page":"12-25","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Trumpet Augmentation and Technological Symbiosis"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"37","author":[{"given":"Joseph","family":"Thibodeau","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), Schulich School of Music, McGill University, 555 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1E3, Canada."}]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL), Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), Schulich School of Music, McGill University, 555 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 1E3, Canada."}]}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0021-9290(88)90147-9"},{"key":"p_3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080/09298215.2011.646278"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"5","author":"Bowers J.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_7","first-page":"1","author":"Cook P.

This study investigated the contribution of ancillary body movements on the perception of musical performances. Using kinematic displays of four clarinetists, perceptual experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to rate specific music-related dimensions of the performance and the performer. Additionally, motions of particular body parts, such as movements of the arms and torso, as well as motion amplitudes of the whole body were manipulated in the kinematic display. It was found that manipulations of arm and torso movements have fewer effects on the observers' ratings of the musicians than manipulations concerning the movement of the whole body.

At times the relationship between emotion and sonification has been contentious due to an implied overlap with music. This paper clarifies the relationship, demonstrating how it can be mutually beneficial. After identifying contexts favourable to auditory display of emotion, and the utility of its development to research in musical emotion, the current state of the field is addressed, reiterating the necessary conditions for sound to qualify as a sonification of emotion. With this framework, strategies for display are presented that use acoustic and structural cues designed to target select auditory-cognitive mechanisms of musical emotion. Two sonifications are then described using these strategies to convey arousal and valence though differing in design methodology: one designed ecologically, the other computationally. Each model is sampled at 15-second intervals at 49 evenly distributed points on the <jats:italic>AV</jats:italic> space, and evaluated using a publically available tool for computational music emotion recognition. The computational design performed 65 times better in this test, but the ecological design is argued to be more useful for emotional communication. Conscious of these limitations, computational design and evaluation is supported for future development.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/s1355771813000411","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,26]],"date-time":"2014-02-26T10:42:46Z","timestamp":1393411366000},"page":"60-69","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":10,"title":["Sonification of Emotion: Strategies and results from the intersection with music"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"R.

Its elaboration was informed by a systematic review of 181 peer-reviewed publications retrieved from the Scopus database, which describe 195 interactive sound installations. The resulting taxonomy is based on the comparison of the different facets of the installations reported in the literature and on existing frameworks, and it was used to characterize all publications. A visualization tool was developed to explore the different facets and identify trends and gaps in the literature. The main findings are presented in terms of bibliometric analysis, and from the three perspectives considered. Various trends were derived from the database, among which we found that interactive sound installations are of prominent interest in the field of computer science. Furthermore, most installations described in the corpus consist of prototypes or belong to exhibitions, output two sensory modalities and include three or more sound sources. Beyond the trends, this review highlights a wide range of practices and a great variety of approaches to the design of interactive sound installations.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390/mti5040019","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T09:52:00Z","timestamp":1618221120000},"page":"19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Comprehensive

El presente dossier tiene como objeto el clero secular iberoamericano, considerando las líneas de investigación y los problemas relacionados con la historia social del clero y su historiografía. Pretende, en particular, comprender sus trayectorias públicas, sus redes de apoyo y las estrategias particulares que condicionan y caracterizan el camino de esos eclesiásticos en diferentes contextos sociopolíticos y geográficos. En este sentido, contribuye a la comprensión de cómo el clero secular concibió su posición desde las jerarquías sociales y también cómo experimentó diversos límites frente a las normas en el ámbito eclesiástico y civil. De esta forma, los textos presentados subrayan tanto su papel en el proceso de consolidación de la Iglesia en el mundo iberoamericano, como los proyectos de ciertos segmentos sociales que reclamaron espacios en el mundo eclesiástico para sus descendientes.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1590/tem-1980-542x2020v260308","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]],"date-time":"2020-11-16T16:08:09Z","timestamp":1605542889000},"page":"645-661","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["El clero secular iberoamericano en la Época Moderna.

In presenting this holistic approach to mapping techniques, we apply the framework to existing works from the literature as well as to new implementations that consider this approach in their construction. As any mapping control structure for a given digital instrument is determined by the musical context in which it is used, we present musical examples that relate the relatively abstract realm of mapping design to the physically and perceptually grounded notions of control and sonic gesture. Making this connection allows mapping to be more clearly seen as a linkage between a physical action and a sonic result. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to translate the discussion on mapping so that it links an abstract and formalized approach—intended for representation and conceptualization—with a viewpoint that considers mapping in its role as a perceived correspondence between physical materials (i.e., those that act on controllers and transducers) and sonic events. This correspondence is, at its heart, driven by our cognitive and embodied understanding of the acoustic world. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00253","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,15]],"date-time":"2014-09-15T19:26:23Z","timestamp":1410809183000},"page":"6-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Mapping Control Structures for Sound Synthesis: Functional and Topological Perspectives"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Doug","family":"Van Nort","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Arts, Media, Performance, and Design York University 4700 Keele St. Toronto, Ontario M3J 1P3, Canada."}]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}]},{"given":"Philippe","family":"Depalle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) McGill University 527 Sherbrooke St. West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada."}]}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002054"},{"key":"p_3","first-page":"101","author":"Bencina R.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_4","first-page":"85","author":"Bevilaqua F.","year":"2005","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_5","first-page":"181","author":"Bowler I.","year":"1990","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_6","first-page":"38","author":"Chadabe J.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771810000154"},{"key":"p_10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002029"},{"key":"p_11","first-page":"57","author":"Hülsen H.","year":"2008","journal-title":"Springer"},{"key":"p_13","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S1355771802002030"},{"key":"p_14","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/TASSP.1986.1164910"},{"key":"p_16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15"},{"key":"p_18","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/0898-1221(88)90255-6"},{"key":"p_19","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/BF00893171"},{"key":"p_20","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162/comj.2006.30.1.49"},{"key":"p_21","first-page":"54","author":"Momeni A.","year":"2003","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_22","first-page":"68","author":"Rovan J.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Proceedings of Kansei: The Technology of Emotion Workshop"},{"key":"p_23","first-page":"138","author":"Schnell N.","year":"2002","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression"},{"key":"p_24","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1076/jnmr.28.2.81.3116"},{"key":"p_25","first-page":"375","author":"Serafin S.","year":"1999","journal-title":"Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference"},{"key":"p_26","first-page":"21","author":"Sibson R.","year":"1981","journal-title":"Interpreting Multivariate Data.

The full use of such vocabularies is nevertheless challenged when improvisers incorporate electronics in their performances. To control electronic sounds and effects, they typically use commercial interfaces whose physicality is likely to limit their freedom of movement. Based on Jim Black's descriptions of his ideal digital musical instrument, embodied improvisation gestures, and stage performance constraints, we develop the concept of a modular wearable MIDI interface to closely meet the needs of professional improvisers, rather than proposing a new generic instrument that would require substantial practice to adapt improvisational techniques already acquired. Our research draws upon different bodies of knowledge, from theoretical principles on collaboration and embodiment to wearable interface design, in order to create a digital vest called <jats:italic>Track It, Zip It (TIZI)</jats:italic> that features two innovative on-body sensors. Allowing for sound control, these sensors are seamlessly integrated with Black's improvisational gesture vocabulary. We then detail the design process of three TIZI prototypes structured by the outcomes of a performance test with Black, a public performance by a novice improviser during the 2017 International Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, and measurements of sensor responses. After commenting on the strengths and weaknesses of the final TIZI prototype, we discuss how our interdisciplinary and collective process involving a world-class improviser at the very center of the design process can provide recommendations to designers who wish to create interfaces better adapted to high-level performers. Finally, we present our goals for the future creation of a wireless version of the vest for a female body based on Diana Policarpo's artistic vision.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.576810","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T04:36:25Z","timestamp":1618202185000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Connecting Free Improvisation Performance and Drumming Gestures Through Digital Wearables"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Amandine","family":"Pras","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mailis G.","family":"Rodrigues","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Victoria","family":"Grupp","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","unstructured":"AndersonL.\n          Laurie Anderson - Drum Dance & Smoke Rings1986"},{"key":"B2","unstructured":"ArthursT.\n          EdinburghThe University of Edinburgh.Secret Gardeners: An Ethnography of Improvised Music in Berlin"},{"key":"B3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"450","DOI":"10.1080/07494467.2016.1257569","article-title":"The creative process of sculpting the air by Jesper Nordin: conceiving and performing a concerto for conductor with live electronics","volume":"35","author":"Bacot","year":"2016","journal-title":"Contemp.

Research has focused on parallels in acoustic features, overlooking facial cues to emotion. In three experiments, we compared moving facial expressions in speech and song. In Experiment 1, vocalists spoke and sang statements each with five emotions. Vocalists exhibited emotion-dependent movements of the eyebrows and lip corners that transcended speech–song differences. Vocalists’ jaw movements were coupled to their acoustic intensity, exhibiting differences across emotion and speech–song. Vocalists’ emotional movements extended beyond vocal sound to include large sustained expressions, suggesting a communicative function. In Experiment 2, viewers judged silent videos of vocalists’ facial expressions prior to, during, and following vocalization. Emotional intentions were identified accurately for movements during and after vocalization, suggesting that these movements support the acoustic message. Experiment 3 compared emotional identification in voice-only, face-only, and face-and-voice recordings. Emotion judgements for voice-only singing were poorly identified, yet were accurate for all other conditions, confirming that facial expressions conveyed emotion more accurately than the voice in song, yet were equivalent in speech. Collectively, these findings highlight broad commonalities in the facial cues to emotion in speech and song, yet highlight differences in perception and acoustic-motor production. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1080/17470218.2014.971034","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,26]],"date-time":"2014-11-26T05:38:51Z","timestamp":1416980331000},"page":"952-970","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Common cues to emotion in the dynamic facial expressions of speech and song"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"68","author":[{"given":"Steven R.","family":"Livingstone","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 1B1"}]},{"given":"William F.","family":"Thompson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"}]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Music Research, CIRMMT, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"}]},{"given":"Caroline","family":"Palmer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3A 1B1"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007/s10919-008-0059-5"},{"key":"bibr2-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1068/p5096"},{"key":"bibr3-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/a0025827"},{"key":"bibr4-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0096-1523.4.3.373"},{"key":"bibr5-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2049"},{"key":"bibr6-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x"},{"key":"bibr7-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1214/aos/1013699998"},{"key":"bibr9-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1163/156856897X00357"},{"key":"bibr10-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/0146167286121001"},{"key":"bibr11-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1515/semi.2004.036"},{"key":"bibr12-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080/14640748108400805"},{"key":"bibr13-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109/79.911197"},{"key":"bibr14-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1121/1.2982369"},{"key":"bibr15-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1167/9.13.7"},{"key":"bibr16-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00136-0"},{"key":"bibr18-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177/030573569302100201"},{"key":"bibr20-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1044/jshr.3303.550"},{"key":"bibr21-17470218.2014.971034","volume-title":"Manual of the facial action coding system (FACS)","author":"Ekman P.","year":"1978"},{"key":"bibr22-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203"},{"key":"bibr23-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/1130938"},{"key":"bibr24-17470218.2014.971034","first-page":"223","volume-title":"Music and emotion: Theory and research","author":"Gabrielsson A.","year":"2001"},{"key":"bibr25-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2307/1416710"},{"key":"bibr26-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2006.23.4.319"},{"key":"bibr27-17470218.2014.971034","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1159/000263031"},{"key":"bibr28-17470218.2014.971034","first-page":"309","volume-title":"Music and emotion: Theory and research","author":"Juslin P.

We have produced several prototypes of force sensors to observe and compare their response with applied forces with those of commercial sensors, as well as those of other conductive materials. Advantages of custom sensors are presented through the description of various examples of music controllers using several kinds of paper touch sensors with a large variety of size and shape. Our goal is to provide digital musical instrument designers with new strategies to circumvent the limited offering of commercial sensors, and to propose ways to exploit these concepts through a dedicated Web site. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1162/comj_a_00237","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,2]],"date-time":"2014-06-02T15:08:40Z","timestamp":1401721720000},"page":"22-35","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["In-House Development of Paper Force Sensors for Musical Applications"],"prefix":"10.1162","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Rodolphe","family":"Koehly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory/Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology McGill University 555 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada , ."}]},{"given":"Marcelo","family":"Wanderley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory/Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology McGill University 555 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada , ."}]},{"given":"Theodorus","family":"van de Ven","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory/Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology McGill University 555 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A 1E3, Canada , ."}]},{"given":"Denis","family":"Curtil","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pulp and Paper Research Centre McGill University 3420 University Street Montreal, Quebec, H3A 2A7, Canada ."}]}],"member":"281","reference":[{"key":"p_1","first-page":"591","author":"Anlauff J.","year":"2010","journal-title":"Proceedings of the Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction"},{"key":"p_2","first-page":"41","author":"Bongers B.","year":"2000","journal-title":"M.
